# Cashfree Payouts — Integration

> **References available:** This SKILL.md covers the core payout flow. For 2FA RSA signature generation, V1 legacy APIs, batch transfer details, all webhook payloads, and key status codes — read `references/REFERENCE.md` in this directory.

---

## 1. Overview

Cashfree Payouts enables instant fund transfers to bank accounts, UPI IDs, cards, and wallets. **Backend-only integration** — no frontend SDK required.

**Core Products:**
- **Payouts Dashboard**: Web-based payout management with approval workflows
- **One Escrow**: Conditional disbursals with escrow management for marketplace settlements
- **Cashgram**: Send instant payout links without collecting bank details from recipients
- **Payout Protect**: Real-time risk control and fraud detection

**Integration Flow:** Setup & Auth → Add Beneficiary → Initiate Transfer → Track Status → Handle Webhooks

---

## 2. Environment Configuration

### V2 APIs (Recommended)

| Environment | Base URL |
|---|---|
| Production | `https://api.cashfree.com/payout` |
| Sandbox | `https://sandbox.cashfree.com/payout` |

### Required Headers (V2)

```
x-client-id: <YOUR_CLIENT_ID>
x-client-secret: <YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>
x-api-version: 2024-01-01
Content-Type: application/json
```

> **V1 legacy APIs** use different base URLs and Bearer token auth — see `references/REFERENCE.md`.

---

## 3. Authentication

### V2 API (Direct Authentication — Recommended)

Use `x-client-id` and `x-client-secret` headers directly with every request. No token generation needed.

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://sandbox.cashfree.com/payout/transfers' \
  -H 'x-client-id: <CLIENT_ID>' \
  -H 'x-client-secret: <CLIENT_SECRET>' \
  -H 'x-api-version: 2024-01-01' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{ ... }'
```

### Generate API Keys

1. Log in to the **Merchant Dashboard**
2. Go to **Payouts Dashboard** → **Developers**
3. Click **API Keys** → **Generate API Keys**
4. Download and securely store the keys

- Maximum of **10 API keys** can be generated
- Production keys require **OTP authentication**

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

**Option 1 — IP Whitelisting:** Whitelist up to 25 IPv4 addresses in Dashboard → Developers → Two-Factor Authentication. Only production requires this; sandbox does not.

**Option 2 — Public Key Signature (Dynamic IP):** Use RSA encryption with `X-Cf-Signature` header. See `references/REFERENCE.md` for full code (PHP, Java, Node.js, Python).

## 4. Payout Methods

| Method | Speed | Limit | Required Details |
|---|---|---|---|
| **IMPS** | Instant | ₹5 lakhs/payout | Beneficiary ID, name, email, phone, bank account, IFSC |
| **NEFT** | Up to 2 hrs (Mon–Sat) | Default for >₹2 lakhs | Beneficiary ID, name, email, phone, bank account, IFSC |
| **UPI** | 24×7 | ₹1 lakh | Beneficiary ID, name, email, phone, VPA |
| **Card** | Instant–48 hrs | All credit cards | Beneficiary ID, name, email, phone, tokenised card number |
| **Paytm wallet** | — | ₹1 lakh (KYC required) | Phone number |
| **Amazon Pay wallet** | — | ₹10,000 | Phone number |

---

## 5. Create Beneficiary

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://sandbox.cashfree.com/payout/beneficiary' \
  -H 'x-client-id: <CLIENT_ID>' \
  -H 'x-client-secret: <CLIENT_SECRET>' \
  -H 'x-api-version: 2024-01-01' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "beneficiary_id": "JOHN18011343",
    "beneficiary_name": "John Doe",
    "beneficiary_instrument_details": {
      "bank_account_number": "00111122233",
      "bank_ifsc": "HDFC0000001",
      "vpa": "test@upi"
    },
    "beneficiary_contact_details": {
      "beneficiary_email": "johndoe@cashfree.com",
      "beneficiary_phone": "9876543210",
      "beneficiary_city": "Bangalore",
      "beneficiary_state": "Karnataka"
    }
  }'
```

**Get Beneficiary:** `GET /payout/beneficiary?beneficiary_id=JOHN18011343`

**Remove Beneficiary:** `DELETE /payout/beneficiary?beneficiary_id=JOHN18011343`

---

## 6. Initiate Transfer

### Standard Transfer (V2)

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://sandbox.cashfree.com/payout/transfers' \
  -H 'x-client-id: <CLIENT_ID>' \
  -H 'x-client-secret: <CLIENT_SECRET>' \
  -H 'x-api-version: 2024-01-01' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "transfer_id": "TRANSFER_001",
    "transfer_amount": 100.00,
    "transfer_currency": "INR",
    "transfer_mode": "banktransfer",
    "beneficiary_details": {
      "beneficiary_id": "JOHN18011343"
    },
    "transfer_remarks": "Payout for order"
  }'
```

**transfer_mode values:** `banktransfer`, `imps`, `neft`, `rtgs`, `upi`, `paytm`, `amazonpay`, `card`, `cardupi`

> The transfer body is **nested**: `beneficiary_details` is an object (pass `beneficiary_id` of an existing beneficiary, or inline `beneficiary_name` + `beneficiary_instrument_details` + `beneficiary_contact_details`). Amount is `transfer_amount`, remarks is `transfer_remarks` — there are no flat `amount`/`remarks` fields.

Transfers are **async by default** — you receive `RECEIVED` immediately; final status via webhook.

### Get Transfer Status

```bash
curl -X GET 'https://sandbox.cashfree.com/payout/transfers?transfer_id=TRANSFER_001' \
  -H 'x-client-id: <CLIENT_ID>' \
  -H 'x-client-secret: <CLIENT_SECRET>' \
  -H 'x-api-version: 2024-01-01'
```

> Status lookup is a **query parameter** (`?transfer_id=` or `?cf_transfer_id=`), not a path segment.

---

## 7. Transfer Status Values

| Status | Description | Final? |
|---|---|---|
| `RECEIVED` | Transfer received for processing | No |
| `PENDING` | Awaiting bank confirmation | No |
| `SUCCESS` | Transfer completed, account debited | No* |
| `FAILED` | Transfer failed | Yes |
| `REVERSED` | Bank reversed the transfer | Yes |
| `REJECTED` | Rejected by Cashfree (risk, blacklist, limits) | Yes |
| `APPROVAL_PENDING` | Requires manual approval in Dashboard | No |
| `QUEUED` | Queued for processing | No |
| `MANUALLY_REJECTED` | Rejected by merchant/team member | Yes |

*SUCCESS can transition to REVERSED if beneficiary bank reverses the transfer.

---

## 8. Webhooks

### Configure

1. Log in to **Merchant Dashboard** → **Payouts Dashboard** → **Developers** → **Webhooks**
2. Click **Add Webhook URL**
3. Enter your HTTPS webhook endpoint
4. Select webhook version: **V2** (recommended)
5. Click **Test & Add Webhook**

### Events

| Event | Description |
|---|---|
| `TRANSFER_SUCCESS` | Transfer successful, funds sent to beneficiary bank |
| `TRANSFER_ACKNOWLEDGED` | Beneficiary bank confirmed credit to end user |
| `TRANSFER_FAILED` | Transfer attempt failed |
| `TRANSFER_REVERSED` | Beneficiary bank reversed the transfer |
| `TRANSFER_REJECTED` | Cashfree rejected the transfer |
| `BULK_TRANSFER_REJECTED` | One or more transfers in batch rejected |
| `BENEFICIARY_INCIDENT` | Service disruption for beneficiary bank/payment mode |
| `CREDIT_CONFIRMATION` | Funds credited to your account balance |
| `LOW_BALANCE_ALERT` | Account balance below threshold |

### Webhook Signature Verification (V2 — HMAC-SHA256)

**CRITICAL:** Always verify signatures. Use the **oldest active client secret**.

```javascript
// Node.js (Express)
const crypto = require("crypto");

app.post("/payout-webhook", express.raw({ type: "application/json" }), (req, res) => {
    const timestamp = req.headers["x-webhook-timestamp"];
    const signature = req.headers["x-webhook-signature"];
    const rawBody = req.body.toString();

    const computedSignature = crypto
        .createHmac("sha256", process.env.CASHFREE_CLIENT_SECRET)
        .update(timestamp + rawBody)
        .digest("base64");

    if (computedSignature === signature) {
        const payload = JSON.parse(rawBody);
        // Route by payload.type
        res.status(200).send("OK");
    } else {
        res.status(400).send("Invalid signature");
    }
});
```

> For Python signature verification, all V2 webhook payloads (TRANSFER_ACKNOWLEDGED, SUCCESS, FAILED, REVERSED, REJECTED, BULK_TRANSFER_REJECTED), V1 webhook payloads, batch transfer details, and key status codes — see `references/REFERENCE.md`.

---

## 9. Security — Never Violate

- **Never expose `x-client-secret` in frontend code.**
- **Never retry on 5XX responses** without checking transfer status first — duplicate transfers are hard to reverse.
- **Store credentials in environment variables**, never hardcoded.
- **Verify webhook signatures** before processing any event.
