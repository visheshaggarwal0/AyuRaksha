# Cashfree Subscriptions — Recurring Payments & Mandates

> **References available:** This SKILL.md covers the core subscription flow. For full API reference with all methods, mobile SDKs (Android/iOS/Flutter/React Native), complete webhook payloads, cut-off timelines, eNACH eligibility, UPI Autopay apps, and refunds — read `references/REFERENCE.md` in this directory.

## 1. Overview

Cashfree Subscriptions automates recurring payment collection. Supports mandates (contracts authorizing recurring debits), multiple payment methods, and both periodic and on-demand billing — all compliant with RBI regulations.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Mandate**: Contract between merchant and customer authorizing recurring debits up to a maximum amount
- **Plan**: Template defining billing terms (frequency, amount, currency)
- **Subscription**: The relationship between a customer and a plan
- **Authorization**: Customer's initial approval of the mandate
- **Charge**: Each individual recurring payment debit

**Integration Flow:**
1. **Create Plan** (optional) → 2. **Create Subscription** → 3. **Customer Authorization** → 4. **Raise Charges** → 5. **Handle Webhooks** → 6. **Manage Lifecycle**

---

## 2. Subscription Types

### Periodic Subscriptions
Debit a **fixed amount** at **fixed intervals** (daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly). For monthly/annual memberships, regular service charges, recurring deliveries.

### On-Demand Subscriptions
Debit **variable amounts** at **any time** up to the mandate maximum. For utility bills, usage-based billing, variable payment schedules.
