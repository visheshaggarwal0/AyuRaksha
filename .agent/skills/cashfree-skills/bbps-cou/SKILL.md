# Cashfree BBPS COU — Bill Payments

> **References available:** This SKILL.md covers the end-to-end bill payment flow and the happy path for all endpoints. For full request/response schemas, field-level constraints, error codes, and the complaint/ticket lifecycle — read `references/REFERENCE.md` in this directory.

---

## 1. Scope & Boundaries

### When to use this skill

- The merchant (acting as an **Agent Institution**) needs to facilitate bill payments on behalf of customers across BBPS-registered billers — electricity boards, gas companies, broadband ISPs, insurance providers, DTH operators, etc.
- The merchant wants to **fetch bills**, **pay bills**, and optionally **raise support tickets** via the Cashfree BBPS COU platform.
- The merchant needs to **look up biller metadata** (categories, biller-specific input params, payment modes, amount limits).

### When NOT to use this skill

- If the use case is collecting payments *into* the merchant's account (not paying bills on behalf of customers) — use `auto-collect/SKILL.md` or `pg/SKILL.md`.
- If the merchant is paying vendors/beneficiaries — use `payouts/SKILL.md`.

### Mental model

BBPS COU operates as an **async two-phase protocol**:
1. **Initiate** — Submit a request (bill fetch or bill payment). Receive a `ref_id` / `transaction_ref_id` immediately with HTTP 202 and status `ACCEPTED`.
2. **Poll** — Call the corresponding status endpoint with that ID until the status changes from `PROCESSING` to a terminal state (`SUCCESS`, `FAILED`, etc.).

This is not a synchronous API — you must poll the status endpoint.

---

## 2. Environments & Auth

| Environment | Base URL |
|---|---|
| Sandbox | `https://sandbox.cashfree.com/bbps/cou` |
| Production | `https://api.cashfree.com/bbps/cou` |

All requests require these headers on every call:

```http
x-client-id: <your-client-id>
x-client-secret: <your-client-secret>
x-api-version: 2025-01-01
```

Credentials are issued per Agent Institution and are available in the [Merchant Dashboard](https://merchant.cashfree.com/verificationsuite/developers/api-keys) for both sandbox and production environments.

## 4. End-to-End Flow

```
1. GET  /v1/billers/categories              → list of category labels (optional discovery)
2. POST /v1/billers/info                    → biller details, input params, payment modes, flow config
3. POST /v1/billers/request/bill-fetch      → 202 ACCEPTED, ref_id + flow returned
                                               (skip for DIRECT_PAY billers — go straight to step 5a)
4. POST /v1/billers/response/bill-fetch     → poll with ref_id until terminal message

[PG payment layer — happens before bill payment]
5a. POST /pg/orders (Cashfree PG)           → create order with bbps block (bill_fetch_ref_id, biller_id, agent_id)
5b. Customer completes payment via Cashfree PG (Checkout / SDK)

6. POST /v1/billers/request/bill-payment    → 202 ACCEPTED, transaction_ref_id returned
7. POST /v1/billers/response/bill-payment   → poll with bill_fetch_ref_id + transaction_ref_id

[Optional — for disputes]
8. POST /v1/billers/request/ticket          → 202 ACCEPTED, ref_id returned
9. POST /v1/billers/response/ticket-status  → poll with ref_id until resolved
```

**Flow is determined by biller config (priority order):**

| Priority | `fetch_requirement` | `support_bill_validation` | Flow |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `MANDATORY` | Any | `FETCH_AND_PAY` |
| 2 | `NOT_SUPPORTED` | `MANDATORY` or `OPTIONAL` | `VALIDATE_AND_PAY` |
| 3 | `NOT_SUPPORTED` | `NOT_SUPPORTED` | `DIRECT_PAY` |
| 4 | `OPTIONAL` | `MANDATORY` | `VALIDATE_AND_PAY` |
| 5 | `OPTIONAL` | Any other | `FETCH_AND_PAY` |

For `DIRECT_PAY` billers (e.g. donation billers), skip bill fetch entirely and go directly to bill payment.

**How `VALIDATE_AND_PAY` differs from `FETCH_AND_PAY`:**

`VALIDATE_AND_PAY` billers require identity validation before payment but do not return bill details. The flow still calls the bill fetch and poll endpoints, but the response is different:

| | `FETCH_AND_PAY` | `VALIDATE_AND_PAY` |
|---|---|---|
| Call bill fetch? | Yes | Yes |
| Poll response includes `bill_details` | Yes | No |
| Poll response includes `biller_response` | Yes | No |
| Poll response includes `additional_info` | Yes | Yes |
| What to echo in payment `bill_details`? | Echo `customer_params` from fetch response | Use the original `input_params` from your fetch request |
| What to echo in payment `biller_response`? | Echo full `biller_response` from fetch | Omit or send empty — no bill data returned |

For `VALIDATE_AND_PAY`, the bill fetch poll response (`message` = `"Bill details fetched successfully"`) only contains:
```json
{
  "bill_fetch_response": { "ref_id": "...", "approval_ref_num": "...", "response_code": "000" },
  "additional_info": { "tag": [...] }
}
```
No `bill_details` or `biller_response` will be present. Proceed to bill payment using the customer's original input params and omit `biller_response` from the payment request.

---

## 5. Step-by-Step: Happy Path

### Step 1 — Get Biller Categories (optional discovery)

```http
GET /v1/billers/categories
```

Response:
```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "message": "Biller categories fetched successfully",
  "data": [
    "Broadband Postpaid", "Cable TV", "Clubs and Associations", "Credit Card",
    "DTH", "Donation", "Education", "Electricity", "Fastag", "Gas",
    "Hospital", "Hospital and Pathology", "Insurance", "LPG Gas",
    "Landline Postpaid", "Loan Repayment", "Mobile Postpaid",
    "Municipal Services", "Municipal Taxes", "Recurring Deposit",
    "Rental", "Subscription", "Water"
  ]
}
```

---

### Step 2 — Get Biller Info

Use this to discover the `biller_id`, the customer input fields required (e.g. account number, consumer number), supported payment modes, and whether bill fetch is mandatory before payment (`fetch_requirement`).

```http
POST /v1/billers/info
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "biller_fetch_request": {
    "biller_id": ["UPCL123"],
    "biller_category_name": ["Electricity"]
  }
}
```

Response includes `biller_customer_params`, `biller_payment_modes`, `fetch_requirement`, and `payment_amount_exactness`.

---

### Step 3 — Initiate Bill Fetch

> **Note:** Skip this step for `DIRECT_PAY` billers (where both `fetch_requirement` and `support_bill_validation` are `NOT_SUPPORTED`). Calling this API for a DIRECT_PAY biller will return a validation error. Go directly to Step 5.

```http
POST /v1/billers/request/bill-fetch
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "bill_fetch_request": {
    "agent_id": "AGENT001",
    "biller_id": "UPCL123",
    "customer_info": {
      "customer_mobile": "9999999999",
      "customer_email": "customer@example.com"
    },
    "input_params": {
      "input": [
        { "param_name": "Consumer Number", "param_value": "12345678" }
      ]
    },
    "agent_device_info": {
      "init_channel": "INT",
      "ip": "192.168.1.1",
      "mac": "01:23:45:67:89:AB"
    }
  }
}
```

Response (HTTP 202):
```json
{
  "status": "ACCEPTED",
  "message": "Bill fetch request accepted for processing",
  "data": {
    "ref_id": "REF20241201001",
    "status": "PROCESSING",
    "flow": "FETCH_AND_PAY"
  }
}
```

Store `ref_id` — needed for status polling and as `bill_fetch_ref_id` in payment. Store `flow` — it determines which fields to expect in the poll response (`FETCH_AND_PAY` | `VALIDATE_AND_PAY` | `DIRECT_PAY`).

---

### Step 4 — Poll Bill Fetch Status

Poll at increasing intervals: 5s → 15s → 30s → 1 min → 3 min. Stop when `message` is `"Bill details fetched successfully"` or `"Bill request failed"`. If still processing after your retry limit, treat as timeout and raise a support ticket.

```http
POST /v1/billers/response/bill-fetch
Content-Type: application/json

{ "ref_id": "REF20241201001" }
```

Success response (HTTP 200):
```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "message": "Bill details fetched successfully",
  "data": {
    "bill_fetch_response": {
      "ref_id": "REF20241201001",
      "approval_ref_num": "NBBL_APPR_001",
      "response_code": "000",
      "response_reason": "Success"
    },
    "bill_details": {
      "customer_params": {
        "tag": [{ "name": "Consumer Number", "value": "12345678" }]
      }
    },
    "biller_response": {
      "customer_name": "John Doe",
      "amount": "150000",
      "due_date": "2024-12-31",
      "bill_number": "BILL2024001",
      "bill_period": "NOV-2024"
    }
  }
}
```

> Amount is in **paise** — `"150000"` = ₹1500.00.

---

### Step 5a — Create Cashfree PG Order

Before initiating the BBPS bill payment, create a Cashfree PG order with a `bbps` block. The `bbps` block links the PG order to the bill fetch and is required for BBPS payments.

```http
POST /pg/orders
x-client-id: <your-client-id>
x-client-secret: <your-client-secret>
x-api-version: 2025-01-01
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "order_amount": 1500.00,
  "order_currency": "INR",
  "customer_details": {
    "customer_id": "CUST001",
    "customer_phone": "9999999999"
  },
  "bbps": {
    "bill_fetch_ref_id": "REF20241201001",   // ref_id from bill fetch
    "biller_id": "UPCL123",
    "agent_id": "AGENT001"
  }
}
```

> All three fields in the `bbps` block — `bill_fetch_ref_id`, `biller_id`, and `agent_id` — are required.

---

### Step 5b — Customer Completes Payment via Cashfree PG

Use the PG order response (payment session) to render the Cashfree Checkout or invoke the SDK so the customer can complete the payment. Once the customer pays successfully through PG, proceed to Step 6.

---

### Step 6 — Initiate Bill Payment

Use `ref_id` from Step 3 as `bill_fetch_ref_id`. Echo back `biller_response` and `bill_details` exactly as received from Step 4.

```http
POST /v1/billers/request/bill-payment
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "bill_payment_request": {
    "head": {
      "bill_fetch_ref_id": "REF20241201001",   // required — ref_id from bill fetch
      "pg_reference_id": "PG_ORDER_001"         // required — your internal order ID
    },
    "customer": {
      "mobile": "9999999999",
      "tag": [{ "name": "EMAIL", "value": "customer@example.com" }]  // optional — EMAIL | AADHAAR | PAN
    },
    "agent": {
      "id": "AGENT001",
      "device": {
        "tag": [
          { "name": "INITIATING_CHANNEL", "value": "INT" },
          { "name": "IP", "value": "192.168.1.1" }
        ]
      }
    },
    "bill_details": {
      "biller": { "id": "UPCL123" },           // required — biller ID
      "customer_params": {
        "tag": [{ "name": "Consumer Number", "value": "12345678" }]
      }
    },
    "biller_response": { ... },                 // echo back from bill fetch status
    "additional_info": { "tag": [] },           // echo back from bill fetch status
    "payment_method": {
      "quick_pay": "No",                        // required — "Yes" if paying without prior fetch
      "split_pay": "No",                        // required
      "off_us_pay": "No",                       // required
      "payment_mode": "UPI"                     // must match biller_payment_modes
    },
    "amount": {
      "amt": {
        "amount": "150000",                     // paise — must match bill amount for Exact billers
        "cust_conv_fee": "0",                   // customer convenience fee in paise
        "cou_cust_conv_fee": "0",               // COU convenience fee in paise
        "currency": "356"                       // numeric INR code
      }
    },
    "payment_information": {
      "tag": [{ "name": "VPA", "value": "customer@upi" }]  // required — instrument details by payment mode
    }
  }
}
```

Response (HTTP 202):
```json
{
  "status": "ACCEPTED",
  "message": "Bill payment request accepted for processing",
  "data": {
    "bill_fetch_ref_id": "REF20241201001",
    "transaction_ref_id": "TXN20241201001",
    "status": "PROCESSING"
  }
}
```

---

### Step 6 — Poll Bill Payment Status

Poll at increasing intervals: 5s → 15s → 30s → 1 min → 3 min. Stop when `data.status` is `"SUCCESS"` or `"FAILED"`. If still processing after your retry limit, treat as timeout and raise a support ticket.

```http
POST /v1/billers/response/bill-payment
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "bill_fetch_ref_id": "REF20241201001",
  "transaction_ref_id": "TXN20241201001"
}
```

Success response (HTTP 200):
```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "message": "Payment successful",
  "data": {
    "status": "SUCCESS",
    "response": {
      "bill_payment_response": {
        "head": { "bill_fetch_ref_id": "REF20241201001" },
        "reason": {
          "approval_ref_num": "APPR123456",
          "response_code": "000",
          "response_reason": "Approved"
        },
        "txn": { "transaction_ref_id": "TXN20241201001" },
        "biller_response": { "customer_name": "John Doe", "amount": "150000" }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

### Step 7 (Optional) — Raise Support Ticket

Use when a transaction needs follow-up or the customer disputes a completed payment. The `disposition` field must use a predefined code (D11–D32) — see `references/REFERENCE.md` for the full disposition code table.

```http
POST /v1/billers/request/ticket
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "ticket_raise_request": {
    "agent_id": "AGENT001",
    "txn_reference_id": "TXN20241201001",
    "disposition": "D11",
    "description": "Payment deducted but biller not updated",
    "customer_mobile": "9999999999",
    "customer_email_id": "customer@example.com",
    "customer_name": "John Doe"
  }
}
```

Response (HTTP 202):
```json
{
  "status": "ACCEPTED",
  "message": "Ticket raise request accepted",
  "data": {
    "ref_id": "TKT_REF_001",
    "status": "PROCESSING"
  }
}
```

---

### Step 8 (Optional) — Get Ticket Status

Poll at increasing intervals: 5s → 15s → 30s → 1 min → 3 min. Stop when `message` is `"Ticket details fetched successfully"` or `"Ticket request failed"`. If still processing after your retry limit, contact Cashfree support with the `ref_id`.

```http
POST /v1/billers/response/ticket-status
Content-Type: application/json

{ "ref_id": "TKT_REF_001" }
```

Response (HTTP 200):
```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "message": "Ticket details fetched successfully",
  "data": {
    "ref_id": "TKT_REF_001",
    "ticket_id": "TKT001",
    "ticket_status": "ASSIGNED",
    "ticket_type": "DISPUTE",
    "assigned": "BILLER",
    "response_code": "000",
    "response_reason": "SUCCESS",
    "description": "Payment deducted but biller not updated"
  }
}
```

---

### Wallet — Balance and Ledger

Use `GET /agent/{agentId}/wallet/balance` to check available balance before initiating payments (returns INR, not paise), and `POST /agent/{agentId}/wallet/ledger` for paginated reconciliation history. Full request/response schemas are in `references/REFERENCE.md`.

---

## 6. Key Rules

- **Always poll** — bill fetch and bill payment are async. A `202 ACCEPTED` response is not final.
- **Use exponential backoff when polling** — 5s → 15s → 30s → 1 min → 3 min intervals.
- **Check flow before calling bill fetch** — for `DIRECT_PAY` billers (both `fetch_requirement` and `support_bill_validation` = `NOT_SUPPORTED`), skip bill fetch entirely and go directly to bill payment. Calling bill fetch for these billers returns a validation error.
- **Echo back biller data** — the bill payment request must include `biller_response`, `bill_details`, and `additional_info` exactly as received from the fetch status response.
- **`payment_information` is required** — pass payment instrument details as `tag[]` with the appropriate fields for the payment mode (e.g. `VPA` for UPI, `CardNum`+`AuthCode` for card, `IFSC`+`AccountNo` for bank transfer).
- **`payment_method` requires three flags** — always include `quick_pay`, `split_pay`, and `off_us_pay` (typically all `"No"`).
- **`amount.amt.currency` is the numeric INR code** — use `"356"`, not `"INR"`.
- **`bill_details.biller.id` is required** — include the biller ID in the payment request alongside the customer params.
- **Amount is in paise** — `"150000"` = ₹1500.00.
- **`bill_fetch_ref_id` links fetch to payment** — the `ref_id` from bill fetch becomes `bill_fetch_ref_id` in bill payment and all subsequent calls.
- **Ticket is post-payment** — `txn_reference_id` in the ticket raise must reference a real completed transaction.
- **Disposition must use a code** — use D11–D32 codes in the `disposition` field; free-text values like `COMPLAINT` are not accepted.
- **All APIs rate limited** — 100 requests per 60 seconds. Exceeding returns HTTP 429.
