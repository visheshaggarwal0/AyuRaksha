# Changelog — PG Backend SDKs

> Read `../changelog.md` (SKILL.md) §2 for the entry schema and §4 for cross-cutting truths. **All data as-of 2026-06-23**, gathered via `gh api` (GitHub tags/releases/contents) and the language registries (npm, PyPI, Maven Central, pkg.go.dev, Packagist, NuGet), cross-checked against registry web pages.

## 0. Cross-SDK summary

### Current versions (trust registry + tag, not the Releases tab)

| Lang | Registry | Latest **published** | Newest git tag | Mismatch |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Node | npm `cashfree-pg` | **6.0.4** | 6.0.4 | No (but newest *GitHub Release* is only 5.1.3) |
| Python | PyPI `cashfree-pg` | **6.0.1** | 6.0.5 | **Yes** — 6.0.2–6.0.5 tagged, not on PyPI |
| Java | Maven Central `com.cashfree.pg.java:cashfree_pg` | **6.0.2** | 6.0.2 | No (search.maven.org solr is stale at 5.0.1 — use maven-metadata.xml) |
| Go | pkg.go.dev `github.com/cashfree/cashfree-pg/v6` | **v6.0.5** | v6.0.5 | No |
| PHP | Packagist `cashfree/cashfree-pg` | **6.0.5** | 6.0.5 | No (caveat: 6.0.1 published *later* with a broader PHP range — see PHP §) |
| .NET | NuGet `cashfree_pg` | **5.0.6** | 6.0.7 | **Yes (major)** — no 6.x on NuGet at all |

### The `x-api-version` argument — version-less on every current major

**The current SDK majors (v5+/v6) all use the instance / version-less call style:** construct a client with credentials, then call methods **without** a leading version argument (the client carries the version; pin it via the `XApiVersion` field). This holds for **Node, Python, Java, Go, .NET, and PHP** — verified against each repo's source/README at its current published tag.

The **version-first** style (`PGCreateOrder("2023-08-01", request, …)` — credentials set statically) is the **pre-v5 legacy** style. Each README still documents it, but under a "**Version < 5**" section for users on old majors; the current majors' method signatures do **not** accept the leading version argument (e.g. Java 6.0.2's `Cashfree.java` exposes only `PGCreateOrder(request, …)`).

| Lang | Current-major call style | Pin the version via | Version-first (pre-v5) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Node | `new Cashfree(env,id,secret)` → `PGCreateOrder(request)` | `cashfree.XApiVersion = "…"` | < 5 only |
| Python | `Cashfree(XClientId=…)` → `PGCreateOrder(req, None, None)` | `XApiVersion` | < 5 only |
| Java | `new Cashfree(env,id,secret,null,null,null)` → `PGCreateOrder(request, …)` | `cashfree.XApiVersion = "…"` | < 5 only |
| Go | `PGCreateOrder(&request, …)` | client config | < v5 only |
| .NET | `new Cashfree(env,id,secret,null,null,null,null)` → `PGCreateOrder(req, …)` | client field | < 5 only |
| PHP | `new \Cashfree\Cashfree($SANDBOX,id,secret,"","","",true)` → `$cashfree->PGCreateOrder($request)` | — | < 5 only |

> ✅ Verified against live SDK source + READMEs (as-of 2026-06-25). All current majors are version-less; **PHP v6 also exposes the instance constructor**, so a no-version call is correct on every current major.

### Minimum runtime

| Lang | Min runtime | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Node | **Not declared** (no `engines` in package.json; effectively Node 14+ via `axios`) | package.json @ 6.0.4 |
| Python | **≥ 3.9** | setup.py `PYTHON_REQUIRES=">=3.9"` @ 6.0.5 |
| Java | **8 (1.8)** — unchanged 4.x→6.x | pom `<java.version>1.8</java.version>` @ 6.0.2 |
| Go | **1.18** | go.mod `go 1.18` @ v6.0.5 |
| PHP | **^8.1** (6.0.0 / 6.0.5); **^7.2 ‖ ^8.0** (6.0.1 and ≤ 5.x) | composer.json |
| .NET | netstandard2.0/2.1, .NET FW 4.7+, .NET 6.0 (published 5.0.6); +net8.0 in unpublished 6.0.7 | csproj |

### The 3.x → 4.0.0 boundary (all languages, 22 Jan 2024)

Every language's 4.0.0 carries the identical note *"SDK now supports our new version of APIs"* → the cut-over from the legacy PG API surface to the **new PG APIs** (default `x-api-version` moved `2022-09-01` → `2023-08-01`; new method names like `PGCreateOrder`, new models, new endpoint host). 4.0.0 is a **hard break vs 3.x** in every language.

## 1. Node SDK (`cashfree-pg`)

`current: 6.0.4 via npm; newest git tag: 6.0.4; mismatch: no (newest GitHub Release is only 5.1.3)`

| version | date | breaking? | headline |
|---|---|---|---|
| 6.0.4 | 2026-05-18 (npm) | **Yes** (major) | Generated from OpenAPI document version `2026-01-01`; major bump. No GitHub Release object for the tag. |
| 5.1.3 | 2026-04-22 | No | Patch over 5.1.x |
| 5.1.0 | 2025-10-08 (npm) | No | Feature bump (5.0.8 → 5.1.0); thin auto-notes |
| 5.0.7 | 2025 (first 5.x on npm) | **Yes** | New instance client; `x-api-version` dropped from method args |
| 4.2.0 | 2024-07-12 | No | Adds Subscription APIs + bug fixes |
| 4.0.10 | 2024-03-19 | No | Easy Split APIs + Order Termination API |
| 4.0.0 | 2024-01-22 | **Yes** | Cut-over to new PG APIs (3.x→4.x boundary) |
| 3.2.15 | 2024-02-05 | No | Last 3.x (legacy API surface) |

### Node `cashfree-pg` 5.0.0 — 2025 (first published as 5.0.7 on npm)
- **Type:** Breaking
- **Breaking?:** Yes — client construction and call signature both change.
- **What changed:** v4 used static config + version-first calls (`Cashfree.XClientId=…; Cashfree.PGCreateOrder("2023-08-01", request)`). v5 introduces `const cashfree = new Cashfree(Cashfree.SANDBOX, "<id>", "<secret>")` then `cashfree.PGCreateOrder(request)` — **`x-api-version` removed from the call**.
- **What to fix (your code):** Adopt the `new Cashfree(env, id, secret)` constructor; drop the api-version string from every `PGxxx(...)` call. (The legacy static style still appears in the README as an alternative, so old code that passes the version may keep compiling — verify against your pinned version.)
- **What to test:** order create/fetch, `PGVerifyWebhookSignature` on the raw body, and that the baked-in default api-version returns the field set you expect.
- **Backward compat:** min Node not enforced (no `engines`); min API version `2023-08-01`; **not drop-in** from v4.
- **Source:** https://github.com/cashfree/cashfree-pg-sdk-nodejs (README @ 5.0.7 vs 4.2.0) · https://www.npmjs.com/package/cashfree-pg — as-of 2026-06-23

### Node `cashfree-pg` 6.0.x — 2026-05-18 (npm 6.0.4)
- **Type:** Breaking (major)
- **Breaking?:** Yes — major version generated from OpenAPI document version `2026-01-01`; SDK default `XApiVersion` = `2026-01-01`.
- **What changed:** npm `cashfree-pg` publishes `6.0.4`, matching git tag `6.0.4`. The tag's generated `index.ts` identifies OpenAPI document version `2026-01-01`, and `api.ts` sets `Cashfree.XApiVersion = "2026-01-01"`.
- **What to fix (your code):** Bump `cashfree-pg` to `^6`; keep the v5+ instance call style (`const cashfree = new Cashfree(env, id, secret)` then `cashfree.PGCreateOrder(request, ...)`); set `cashfree.XApiVersion = "2025-01-01"` before calls if you need the latest documented REST API contract instead of the SDK default.
- **What to test:** order create/fetch, every other method you call, webhook signature verification, and the `x-api-version` actually sent on the wire.
- **Backward compat:** no declared Node `engines` requirement in `package.json`; call signatures are unchanged from v5 for the checked methods (`PGCreateOrder(request, x_request_id?, x_idempotency_key?, options?)`, `PGFetchOrder(order_id, ...)`, `PGVerifyWebhookSignature(signature, rawBody, timestamp)`); behavior changes can come from the generated `2026-01-01` API surface/default version.

### Node `cashfree-pg` 4.0.0 — 2024-01-22 (boundary)
- **Type:** Breaking
- **Breaking?:** Yes — new PG API endpoint set; new method names/models vs 3.x.
- **What changed:** Retargeted to the new PG APIs (`pg-new-apis-endpoint`).
- **What to fix (your code):** migrate 3.x method/model names to the new PG API methods; set `x-api-version: 2023-08-01`.
- **What to test:** full re-test — different API surface.
- **Backward compat:** min API version `2023-08-01`; not drop-in from 3.x.
- **Source:** https://github.com/cashfree/cashfree-pg-sdk-nodejs/releases/tag/4.0.0 — as-of 2026-06-23

## 2. Python SDK (`cashfree-pg`)

`current: 6.0.1 via PyPI; newest git tag: 6.0.5; mismatch: yes (6.0.2–6.0.5 tagged but not on PyPI; newest GitHub Release only 5.0.5)`

| version | date | breaking? | headline |
|---|---|---|---|
| 6.0.1 | 2026-05-18 (PyPI) | **Yes** (major) | New OpenAPI spec (`2026-01-01`); notes sparse |
| 6.0.0 | 2026-05-18 (PyPI) | **Yes** (major) | Major bump to new spec |
| 5.0.5 | 2026-01-21 (PyPI) | **Yes** | Instance constructor added; instance-style calls omit the version (legacy static style still passes it first) |
| 4.5.1 | 2025-10-31 | No | Feature bump; thin auto-notes |
| 4.2.0 | 2024-07-12 | No | Subscription APIs |
| 4.0.10 | 2024-03-19 | No | Easy Split + Order Termination |
| 4.0.0 | 2024-01-22 | **Yes** | Cut-over to new PG APIs (boundary) |
| 3.2.12 | 2024-01-29 | No | Last 3.x (legacy) |

### Python `cashfree-pg` 5.0.x — 2026-01-21 (PyPI 5.0.5)
- **Type:** Breaking (call-style change)
- **Breaking?:** Yes — the call style changed.
- **What changed:** v4 used static class config (`Cashfree.XClientId=…`) + `Cashfree().PGCreateOrder(x_api_version, req, None, None)` (version first). v5+ switches to a configured instance: `cashfree = Cashfree(XEnvironment=…, XClientId=…, XClientSecret=…)` then `cashfree.PGCreateOrder(req, None, None)` — **version-less** (verified against `cashfree_pg/api_client.py`: `def PGCreateOrder(self, create_order_request=None, …)`, version taken from `self.XApiVersion`). The v5+ method signature has **no leading version argument**; the README shows the version-first call only under its "Version < 5" section for users still on v4.
- **What to fix (your code):** migrate to the instance constructor and **drop the version first-arg** from every method. To pin the published v5 contract, set `cashfree.XApiVersion = "2025-01-01"`.
- **What to test:** order create/fetch; that the instance carries credentials; webhook verification.
- **Backward compat:** Python ≥ 3.9; min API version `2023-08-01`; **not source-compatible with v4 version-first calls** — the version-first signature is gone in v5+.
- **Source:** https://github.com/cashfree/cashfree-pg-sdk-python (README @ 6.0.1 — both styles shown) · https://pypi.org/project/cashfree-pg/ — as-of 2026-06-23

### Python `cashfree-pg` 6.0.x — 2026-05-18 (PyPI 6.0.1)
- **Type:** Breaking (major)
- **Breaking?:** Yes — regenerated against the `2026-01-01` spec.
- **What changed:** new spec models; SDK default `x-api-version` = `2026-01-01`. Call style is unchanged from 5.x — still the **version-less instance** style.
- **What to fix (your code):** bump to `cashfree-pg>=6,<7`; re-run tests; decide pin `2025-01-01` (set `cashfree.XApiVersion`) vs the SDK default `2026-01-01`.
- **What to test:** model (de)serialization for every method you use; webhook verification.
- **Backward compat:** Python ≥ 3.9; call convention unchanged from 5.x. **PyPI tops at 6.0.1** — 6.0.2–6.0.5 are tagged but unpublished.
- **Source:** https://pypi.org/project/cashfree-pg/ (6.0.1) — as-of 2026-06-23 *(field-level delta unverified — notes sparse)*

### Python `cashfree-pg` 4.0.0 — 2024-01-22 (boundary)
- **Breaking?:** Yes — new PG APIs vs 3.x. **What to fix:** migrate method/model names; `x-api-version: 2023-08-01`. **What to test:** full re-test. **Backward compat:** not drop-in from 3.x. **Source:** https://github.com/cashfree/cashfree-pg-sdk-python/releases/tag/4.0.0 — as-of 2026-06-23

## 3. Java SDK (`com.cashfree.pg.java:cashfree_pg`)

`current: 6.0.2 via Maven Central; newest git tag: 6.0.2; mismatch: no (use maven-metadata.xml — search.maven.org solr is stale at 5.0.1; newest GitHub Release only 5.0.1)`

| version | date | breaking? | headline |
|---|---|---|---|
| 6.0.2 | 2026-05-26 (Maven) | **Yes** (major) | New API spec; major bump |
| 6.0.0/6.0.1 | 2026 (Maven) | **Yes** (major) | Major bump |
| 5.0.1 | 2025-12-18 | No | Patch over 5.0.0; thin auto-notes |
| 5.0.0 | ~2025-04-01 (Maven) | **Yes** | New `new Cashfree(id, secret, …)` instance; `x-api-version` dropped from args |
| 4.5.0 | 2025-02-25 | No | Feature bump |
| 4.2.4 | 2024-10-07 | No | Patch |
| 4.2.0 | 2024-07-12 | No | Subscription APIs |
| 4.0.1 | 2024-01-22 | **Yes** | Cut-over to new PG APIs (boundary) |
| 3.2.12 | 2024-01-29 | No | Last 3.x (legacy) |

### Java 5.0.0 — ~2025-04-01
- **Type:** Breaking
- **Breaking?:** Yes — credential setup + call signature change.
- **What changed:** v4: `Cashfree.XClientId=…; Cashfree cashfree = new Cashfree(); cashfree.PGCreateOrder(xApiVersion, request, …)` (version 1st arg). v5+: `Cashfree cashfree = new Cashfree(Cashfree.SANDBOX, "<id>", "<secret>", null,null,null); cashfree.PGCreateOrder(request, null,null,null)` — **version removed** (verified against `Cashfree.java`: only the version-less signature exists; pin via the `XApiVersion` field). The version-first call is the **pre-v5** style — the README shows it only under "Version < 5"; it will not compile against the v5+ method signatures.
- **What to fix (your code):** pass credentials into `new Cashfree(id, secret, …)`; remove the `xApiVersion` first argument from every call.
- **What to test:** `ApiResponse<OrderEntity>` order create/fetch; `ApiException` handling; default api-version behavior.
- **Backward compat:** Java 8 (unchanged); min API version `2023-08-01`; not drop-in.
- **Source:** https://github.com/cashfree/cashfree-pg-sdk-java (README @ 5.0.0 vs 4.2.4) · https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.cashfree.pg.java/cashfree_pg — as-of 2026-06-23

### Java 6.0.x — 2026-05-26 (Maven 6.0.2)
- **Breaking?:** Yes (major; new spec). **What to fix:** bump to `6.0.2`; re-test; decide api-version pin. **What to test:** all called methods; webhook verify. **Backward compat:** Java 8; call signature unchanged from 5.x. **Source:** https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.cashfree.pg.java/cashfree_pg — as-of 2026-06-23 *(field-level delta unverified)*

### Java 4.0.1 — 2024-01-22 (boundary)
- **Breaking?:** Yes — new PG APIs. **What to fix:** migrate from 3.x; `x-api-version: 2023-08-01`. **Backward compat:** Java 8; not drop-in from 3.x. **Source:** https://github.com/cashfree/cashfree-pg-sdk-java/releases/tag/4.0.1 — as-of 2026-06-23

## 4. Go SDK (`github.com/cashfree/cashfree-pg`)

`current: v6.0.5 via pkg.go.dev; newest git tag: v6.0.5; mismatch: no (newest GitHub Release only v5.1.0)`
Module-path note: v6 requires importing `github.com/cashfree/cashfree-pg/v6` (Go semantic-import-versioning).

| version | date | breaking? | headline |
|---|---|---|---|
| v6.0.5 | 2026-05-12 | **Yes** (major) | `/v6` module path; new spec |
| v6.0.0 | 2026 | **Yes** (major) | Major bump → `/v6` import path |
| v5.1.0 | 2026-02-20 | No | Feature bump; thin auto-notes |
| v5.0.6 | 2025-04-08 | No | Patch (5.0.1–5.0.6 same-day patch train) |
| v5.0.0 | 2025-04-07 | **Yes** | No-version call form; version no longer required as 1st arg |
| v4.3.10 | 2025-01-09 | No | Patch |
| v4.2.0 | 2024-07-12 | No | Subscription APIs |
| v4.0.1 | 2024-01-22 | **Yes** | Cut-over to new PG APIs (boundary) |
| v3.2.14 | 2024-02-01 | No | Last 3.x (legacy) |

### Go v5.0.0 — 2025-04-07
- **Type:** Breaking
- **Breaking?:** Yes — primary call form drops the version argument.
- **What changed:** v4 `cashfree.PGCreateOrder(&version, &request, nil, nil, nil)` (version pointer 1st arg). v5+ `cashfree.PGCreateOrder(&request, nil, nil, nil)`. The legacy form is still shown as an alternative in v5/v6 READMEs (appears overloaded/both-supported).
- **What to fix (your code):** drop the leading `&version` from calls.
- **What to test:** `(response, httpResponse, err)` order create/fetch; credential config via `cashfree.XClientId = &clientId`; error path.
- **Backward compat:** Go 1.18; min API version `2023-08-01`; not drop-in.
- **Source:** https://github.com/cashfree/cashfree-pg (README @ v5.0.0 vs v4.2.0) — as-of 2026-06-23

### Go v6.0.0 — 2026 (latest v6.0.5, 2026-05-12)
- **Type:** Breaking (major — **import path change**)
- **Breaking?:** Yes — module path becomes `/v6`.
- **What changed:** new spec; import path `github.com/cashfree/cashfree-pg/v6`.
- **What to fix (your code):** update the import to `…/cashfree-pg/v6` and bump `go.mod`; `go get github.com/cashfree/cashfree-pg/v6@v6.0.5`.
- **What to test:** compile (import path), all called methods, webhook verify.
- **Backward compat:** Go 1.18; call signature unchanged from v5; not drop-in (import path).
- **Source:** https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cashfree/cashfree-pg/v6 — as-of 2026-06-23
- **Caveat:** the Go module proxy lists v5.1.4–v5.1.9 that are absent from the GitHub tag list (max v5.1.0) — possibly retracted/proxy artifacts; not in the timeline above. Follow-up needed.

### Go v4.0.1 — 2024-01-22 (boundary)
- **Breaking?:** Yes — new PG APIs. **What to fix:** migrate from 3.x; `x-api-version: 2023-08-01`. **Backward compat:** Go 1.18; not drop-in from 3.x. **Source:** https://github.com/cashfree/cashfree-pg/releases/tag/v4.0.1 — as-of 2026-06-23

## 5. PHP SDK (`cashfree/cashfree-pg`)

`current: 6.0.5 via Packagist; newest git tag: 6.0.5; mismatch: no (caveat below; newest GitHub Release = 6.0.1)`

> **Packagist resolution caveat:** 6.0.5 is the top semver, but **6.0.1 was published LATER (2026-05-19) than 6.0.5 (2026-05-18)** and carries a *broader* PHP constraint (`^7.2 ‖ ^8.0`), whereas 6.0.5 requires `^8.1`. `composer require cashfree/cashfree-pg:^6.0` resolves to **6.0.5** by default — which will fail to install on PHP < 8.1. Pin **6.0.1** if you need PHP 7.2–8.0.

| version | date | breaking? | headline |
|---|---|---|---|
| 6.0.5 | 2026-05-18 | **Yes** (major) | New spec; requires PHP ^8.1 |
| 6.0.1 | 2026-05-19 | **Yes** (major) | Same major; PHP `^7.2 ‖ ^8.0` build |
| 6.0.0 | 2026-05-18 | **Yes** (major) | Major bump; PHP ^8.1 |
| 5.0.3 | 2025-04-04 | No* | Major bump but **call signature unchanged**; thin auto-notes |
| 4.2.0 | 2024-07-12 | No | Subscription APIs |
| 4.0.10 | 2024-03-19 | No | Easy Split + Order Termination |
| 4.0.0 | 2024-01-22 | **Yes** | Cut-over to new PG APIs (boundary) |
| 3.2.12 | 2024-01-29 | No | Last 3.x (legacy) |

### PHP 6.0.x — 2026-05 (major, runtime requirement + version-less call style)
- **Type:** Breaking (runtime requirement)
- **Breaking?:** Yes — minimum PHP raised.
- **What changed:** Like the other v5+ SDKs, current PHP uses the **instance / version-less** style — verified against `lib/Cashfree.php` source: constructor `new \Cashfree\Cashfree($XEnvironment, $XClientId, $XClientSecret, $XPartnerApiKey, $XPartnerMerchantId, $XClientSignature, $XEnableErrorAnalytics)`, an instance field `public $XApiVersion = "2026-01-01"` for pinning, and `PGCreateOrder($create_order_request, $x_request_id = null, $x_idempotency_key = null, $http_client = null)` — **no leading `$x_api_version` argument**. The README still documents the static `\Cashfree\Cashfree::$XClientId = …` + version-first call under its "Version < 5" section for users on old majors. The 6.0.0/6.0.5 bump also **raises min PHP to ^8.1** and targets a new spec.
- **What to fix (your code):** bump your PHP runtime to 8.1+ for 6.0.0/6.0.5 (**or** pin `6.0.1` to stay on PHP 7.2–8.0). If migrating off a pre-v5 SDK, switch to the instance constructor and **drop the `$x_api_version` first argument** from every call; pin via `$cashfree->XApiVersion = "2025-01-01"` if you need the published v5 contract.
- **What to test:** order create/fetch; `guzzlehttp/guzzle ^7.3` satisfied; webhook handling.
- **Backward compat:** PHP ^8.1 (6.0.0/6.0.5) or ^7.2‖^8.0 (6.0.1, ≤5.x). Within the v5+ line the call signature is stable; the version-first→version-less change is only a concern when migrating up from a pre-v5 SDK.
- **Source:** https://github.com/cashfree/cashfree-pg-sdk-php (composer.json @ 6.0.5 vs 6.0.1) · https://packagist.org/packages/cashfree/cashfree-pg — as-of 2026-06-23
- **Docs bug:** the README at tag 6.0.5 contains copy-pasted *JavaScript* example syntax (`Cashfree.PGCreateOrder(request).then(...)`) — a documentation error, not the actual PHP API. The 6.0.1 and 5.0.3 READMEs show the correct PHP.

### PHP 4.0.0 — 2024-01-22 (boundary)
- **Breaking?:** Yes — new PG APIs. **What to fix:** migrate from 3.x. **Backward compat:** not drop-in from 3.x. **Source:** https://github.com/cashfree/cashfree-pg-sdk-php/releases/tag/4.0.0 — as-of 2026-06-23

## 6. .NET SDK (`cashfree_pg`)

`current: 5.0.6 via NuGet; newest git tag: 6.0.7; mismatch: YES (major) — there is NO 6.x on NuGet`

> **The biggest registry-vs-git divergence.** NuGet tops out at **5.0.6 (2025-04-08)**; git tags go to **6.0.7** (the 6.0.7 csproj sets `<Version>6.0.7</Version>`), but **nothing 6.x is published to NuGet** — `dotnet add package cashfree_pg` gets you 5.0.6.

### .NET 5.0.0 — 2025
- **Type:** Breaking
- **Breaking?:** Yes — credential setup + call signature change.
- **What changed:** v4 `var cashfree = new Cashfree(); cashfree.PGCreateOrder("2022-09-01", request, null,null,null)` (version 1st arg, static creds). v5+ `var cashfree = new Cashfree(Cashfree.SANDBOX, "<id>", "<secret>", null,null,null,null); cashfree.PGCreateOrder(request, null,null,null)` — **version removed** (version-less instance methods; README shows version-first only under its "Version < 5" section).
- **What to fix (your code):** use the `new Cashfree(env, id, secret, …)` constructor; remove the version first arg.
- **What to test:** order create/fetch; exception handling; default api-version; target-framework compatibility; **TLS 1.2+ on old .NET Framework** (see `pg/backend-sdks` skill).
- **Backward compat:** netstandard2.0/2.1, .NET FW 4.7+, .NET 6.0; min API version `2023-08-01`; not drop-in.

### .NET 4.0.0 — 2024-01-22 (boundary)
