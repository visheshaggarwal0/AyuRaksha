# Migrating From PayU to Cashfree Payments

> **References available:** This SKILL.md covers the end-to-end migration path and the most common code rewrites. For the exhaustive endpoint-by-endpoint map, field-level diffs, Bolt JS → Cashfree.js translation, per-language SDK rewrites, refunds, the `verify_payment`/`cancel_refund_transaction` command-API translation, SI → Subscriptions, mobile SDKs, and status/error code tables — read `references/REFERENCE.md` in this directory.

---

## 1. Scope & Boundaries

### When to use this skill

- The codebase **already integrates PayU** (posts a form to `secure.payu.in/_payment` / `test.payu.in/_payment`, computes a `SHA-512` request hash from `key|txnid|amount|productinfo|firstname|email|...|SALT`, verifies a reverse hash on `surl`/`furl`, calls the `merchant/postservice` command API with `verify_payment` / `cancel_refund_transaction`, loads PayU **Bolt** `bolt.min.js`, or uses the PayU **CheckoutPro** mobile SDK).
- The developer wants to **replace** that integration with Cashfree Payments — keeping the same user-facing flow but swapping the payment provider.
- The developer asks "how do I migrate from PayU", "what's the Cashfree equivalent of the PayU `_payment` post", "what replaces the PayU hash", "what replaces `verify_payment`", or similar.
- You need to rewrite **Payment requests, Hash generation/verification, Checkout, Webhooks, Verification, Refunds, or Standing Instructions (SI / recurring)** code from PayU to Cashfree.

### When NOT to use this skill

- The project has **no existing PayU code** — use `getting-started/SKILL.md` and the relevant `pg/*/SKILL.md` instead; a fresh integration is simpler than a migration.
- The developer is staying on PayU and just asking questions — this skill is one-way (PayU → Cashfree) and assumes a switch is the goal.
- The ask is about a product Cashfree offers differently (Verification Suite, Secure ID, Cross-Border) and has no direct PayU analog — go to that product's skill.
- The ask is about **PayU Payments / Payouts disbursals only** with no PG checkout migration — jump straight to `payouts/SKILL.md`.

### What this skill does NOT do

- It does not preserve PayU IDs. `mihpayid` and PayU's internal references have **no Cashfree equivalent** — new orders created via Cashfree will have fresh `order_id` / `cf_payment_id` values. Your merchant `txnid` can be reused as Cashfree's `order_id` (both are merchant-generated), but historical PayU transactions stay in PayU; only **new** traffic moves.
- It does not perform data migration (historical payments, refund records, settlement reports, saved cards / tokens). Saved instruments held by PayU are **not portable** — future saved-card flows must be rebuilt with Cashfree Token Vault. Run a parallel-reporting period; pull both PayU and Cashfree reports during cutover.

## 2. Concept Mapping — Read This First

Both gateways let you start a payment, redirect/checkout, verify on the backend, and react to webhooks. But PayU's **hash-based** security model is fundamentally different from Cashfree's, and **five specific gotchas** trip up every migration. Internalize these before touching code:

| # | Gotcha | PayU | Cashfree |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **API auth** | No headers. Every request carries a `SHA-512` **hash** built from `key` + secret `salt`. The salt never leaves your server | Three headers: `x-client-id`, `x-client-secret`, `x-api-version: 2025-01-01`. **No request hash** — the secret is sent (server-to-server only) in a header |
| 2 | **Amount unit** | Rupees (decimal/string). `₹500` = `"500.00"` | Rupees (decimal). `₹500` = `order_amount: 500.00` — **good news: no unit change**, just drop the string-quoting and send a number |
| 3 | **Checkout handoff** | Server computes the `hash` and posts a form (`key`, `txnid`, `amount`, `hash`, `surl`, `furl`, …) to `_payment`, or hands the same fields + hash to **Bolt** | Server gets a **`payment_session_id`** (short-lived) — no key/salt/hash on the client. Client passes only the session id to Cashfree.js / Drop-in |
| 4 | **Success verification** | Verify the **reverse hash** PayU posts to `surl`, then optionally call `verify_payment`. Trust is anchored on the hash | Verified by the backend via `GET /pg/orders/{order_id}` (`PGFetchOrder`). There is **no client-side success hash** — re-fetch and check `order_status === "PAID"` |
| 5 | **Refund target** | `cancel_refund_transaction` command, keyed by PayU's **`mihpayid`**, with a merchant `token` (≤23 chars) and amount | `POST /pg/orders/{order_id}/refunds` — keyed by your **`order_id`**, amount in rupees, requires a merchant-generated `refund_id` |

### Object & Identifier Map

| Concept | PayU | Cashfree |
|---|---|---|
| Merchant transaction id | `txnid` (you generate it) | `order_id` (you generate it — reuse the same value) |
| Gateway payment id | `mihpayid` (PayU's id) | `cf_payment_id` (Cashfree's id) |
| Bank reference | `bank_ref_num` | `bank_reference` |
| Refund id | merchant `token` (var2, ≤23 chars) + PayU `request_id` | your merchant-provided `refund_id` |
| Short-lived checkout token | *(none — server posts `key`+`hash`+fields)* | `payment_session_id` |
| Public-safe key | `key` (sent to client, but **useless without server-side hash**) | **None — nothing is client-safe.** Only `payment_session_id` goes to the client |
| Server secret | `salt` (used only to build/verify hashes; never sent) | `x-client-secret` (sent in a header on server-to-server calls) |
| Webhook secret | the same `salt` (webhook hash uses it) | same as `x-client-secret` |

### Credential & URL Map

| | PayU | Cashfree |
|---|---|---|
| Sandbox/Test base URL | `https://test.payu.in` (`/_payment`, `/merchant/postservice`) | `https://sandbox.cashfree.com/pg` |
| Production base URL | `https://secure.payu.in` (`/_payment`); `https://info.payu.in/merchant/postservice.php` (commands) | `https://api.cashfree.com/pg` |
| Dashboard | `onboarding.payu.in` | `merchant.cashfree.com` |
| Get credentials | Dashboard → Test Mode → Developer → API Keys (`key` + `Salt`) | Developers → API Keys (`App ID` + `Secret Key`) |
| Environment switch | Change base URL + `key`/`salt` | Change **both** keys **and** base URL |

### Status Value Map

| Concept | PayU values | Cashfree equivalent |
|---|---|---|
| Payment outcome (callback `status`) | `success` / `failure` / `pending` | `PAID` (order) + `SUCCESS` (payment) / `FAILED` or `USER_DROPPED` / `PENDING` |
| Granular state (`unmappedstatus`) | `captured`, `auth`, `failed`, `userCancelled`, … | `SUCCESS`, pre-auth state, `FAILED`, `USER_DROPPED` |
| Refund status | `success` (PayU `error_code` 102 = success), `pending`, `failure` | `SUCCESS`, `PENDING`, `FAILED` |

> **Critical PayU semantics:** PayU explicitly instructs merchants to treat **`pending` as a NON-success (failed)** transaction at callback time, and to only ever trust the `status` field after verifying the hash. Cashfree splits this cleanly: `order_status` (`ACTIVE` / `PAID` / `EXPIRED` / `TERMINATED`) plus a separate `payment_status` (`SUCCESS` / `FAILED` / `PENDING` / `USER_DROPPED`). **Do not string-replace `success` with `PAID`** — re-model the state machine: fulfil only on `order_status === "PAID"`, and treat Cashfree `PENDING` as "keep waiting / poll", not as a hard failure.

**Capture:** Cashfree auto-captures by default, matching PayU's default `captured` behaviour. If you used PayU pre-authorization (auth-then-capture), that maps to Cashfree **Pre-Authorization** (`order_meta` config + `/authorization` endpoint) — see REFERENCE §6.

---

## 3. Migration Workflow

Follow these seven steps in order. Do not skip the parallel-run step — it catches hash, webhook, and state-machine bugs before production traffic.

### Step 1 — Inventory the existing PayU surface

Before writing any Cashfree code, grep the codebase and list:

1. Every place the **request hash** is built — `sha512(...)` / `hash_hmac` / `crypto.createHash("sha512")` over `key|txnid|amount|productinfo|firstname|email|udf1|...|SALT`. Each is a future bug surface.
2. Every form post / redirect to `secure.payu.in/_payment` or `test.payu.in/_payment`, and every `bolt.launch(...)` / Bolt `bolt.min.js` load.
3. Every `surl` / `furl` handler that reads PayU's POST-back (`status`, `mihpayid`, `txnid`, `hash`) and verifies the **reverse hash**.
4. Every call to the command API `merchant/postservice` — `verify_payment`, `get_Transaction_Details`, `cancel_refund_transaction`, `check_action_status`, SI commands (`si_transaction`, `pre_debit_SI`, `mandate_revoke`, `upi_mandate_*`).
5. Every webhook / S2S handler that verifies a PayU hash.
6. All env vars: `PAYU_MERCHANT_KEY`, `PAYU_MERCHANT_SALT` (and any `PAYU_*` URL/config).
7. Any **SI / recurring** request (`si=1`, `si_details` JSON, `api_version=7`) and any saved-card / token logic.

Keep this list — it's your migration checklist.

### Step 2 — Get Cashfree credentials and configure env

- Sign up / sign in to [merchant.cashfree.com](https://merchant.cashfree.com).
- Developers → API Keys → copy **Test** `App ID` + `Secret Key` first (production keys come later, post-KYC).
- Replace env vars:

    | PayU var | → | Cashfree var |
    |---|---|---|
    | `PAYU_MERCHANT_KEY` | → | `CASHFREE_APP_ID` |
    | `PAYU_MERCHANT_SALT` | → | `CASHFREE_SECRET_KEY` (used for both API auth **and** webhook verification) |

  Keep the PayU vars around until cutover so you can dual-run during testing.

- Set `CASHFREE_ENV=SANDBOX` (later `PRODUCTION`). Derive base URL from it — never hardcode.

### Step 3 — Swap the SDK

PayU's official backend SDKs live under the `payu-india` GitHub org and are not consistently published to language registries; many merchants hand-roll the hash + HTTP. Cashfree ships first-class SDKs — prefer them.

| PayU package / approach | → | Cashfree package |
|---|---|---|
| `payu-india/payu-sdk-node` or hand-rolled hash + `_payment` post | → | `cashfree-pg` (npm) |
| `payu-india/web-sdk-python` or hand-rolled | → | `cashfree-pg` (PyPI) |
| `in.payu:payu-sdk` (Maven) or hand-rolled | → | `com.cashfree.pg.java:cashfree_pg` |
| `payu-india/web-sdk-go` or hand-rolled | → | `github.com/cashfree/cashfree-pg/v6` |
| `payu-india/payubiz_php7` sample or hand-rolled | → | `cashfree/cashfree-pg` (Composer) |
| Hand-rolled .NET (no official PayU SDK) | → | `cashfree_pg` (NuGet) |

The single biggest deletion in this step: **the entire hash-generation helper goes away.** Cashfree authenticates with headers (the SDK sets them) — there is no per-request SHA-512 to compute on the order-create path.

### Step 4 — Rewrite backend: create order, verify payment, refund

Pattern follows the 5 gotchas above. Node.js example (Express):

**Before (PayU — hand-rolled hash + form post):**
```javascript
import crypto from "crypto";

const PAYU_BASE =
    process.env.PAYU_ENV === "PRODUCTION"
        ? "https://secure.payu.in"
        : "https://test.payu.in";

app.post("/create-order", (req, res) => {
    const txnid = req.body.receiptId;            // you generate it
    const amount = req.body.amountRupees.toFixed(2); // rupees as string
    const { productinfo, firstname, email } = req.body;

    // PayU request hash: key|txnid|amount|productinfo|firstname|email|udf1..udf5||||||SALT
    const hashString =
        `${process.env.PAYU_MERCHANT_KEY}|${txnid}|${amount}|${productinfo}|${firstname}|${email}|||||||||||${process.env.PAYU_MERCHANT_SALT}`;
    const hash = crypto.createHash("sha512").update(hashString).digest("hex");

    // Render an auto-submitting form to PayU's _payment (or hand these to Bolt)
    res.json({
        action: `${PAYU_BASE}/_payment`,
        fields: {
            key: process.env.PAYU_MERCHANT_KEY,
            txnid, amount, productinfo, firstname, email,
            phone: req.body.phone,
            surl: `${process.env.APP_URL}/payu/success`,
            furl: `${process.env.APP_URL}/payu/failure`,
            hash,
        },
    });
});

// surl handler — verify the REVERSE hash, then trust status
app.post("/payu/success", (req, res) => {
    const p = req.body; // status, mihpayid, txnid, amount, hash, ...
    const reverse =
        `${process.env.PAYU_MERCHANT_SALT}|${p.status}|||||||||||${p.email}|${p.firstname}|${p.productinfo}|${p.amount}|${p.txnid}|${process.env.PAYU_MERCHANT_KEY}`;
    const expected = crypto.createHash("sha512").update(reverse).digest("hex");
    if (expected !== p.hash) return res.status(400).send("bad hash");
    if (p.status === "success") fulfillOrder(p.txnid);
    res.redirect("/order/" + p.txnid);
});

// Refund — command API, keyed by mihpayid
const cmd = "cancel_refund_transaction";
const refundHash = crypto.createHash("sha512")
    .update(`${process.env.PAYU_MERCHANT_KEY}|${cmd}|${mihpayid}|${process.env.PAYU_MERCHANT_SALT}`)
    .digest("hex");
await postForm(`${PAYU_BASE}/merchant/postservice?form=2`, {
    key: process.env.PAYU_MERCHANT_KEY, command: cmd, hash: refundHash,
    var1: mihpayid, var2: `rfnd_${Date.now()}`.slice(0, 23), var3: refundAmount,
});
```

**After (Cashfree):**
```javascript
import { Cashfree, CFEnvironment } from "cashfree-pg";

const cashfree = new Cashfree(
    process.env.CASHFREE_ENV === "PRODUCTION"
        ? CFEnvironment.PRODUCTION
        : CFEnvironment.SANDBOX,
    process.env.CASHFREE_APP_ID,
    process.env.CASHFREE_SECRET_KEY,
);

app.post("/create-order", async (req, res) => {
    const orderId = req.body.receiptId; // reuse your PayU txnid scheme — Cashfree echoes it back
    const response = await cashfree.PGCreateOrder({
        order_id: orderId,
        order_amount: req.body.amountRupees,   // RUPEES, decimal number — no .toFixed string, no hash
        order_currency: "INR",
        customer_details: {
            customer_id: req.body.customerId,           // required
            customer_phone: req.body.phone,             // required, 10-digit
            customer_email: req.body.email,
            customer_name: req.body.firstname,
        },
        order_meta: {
            return_url: `${process.env.APP_URL}/return/${orderId}`, // replaces surl/furl (one URL)
            notify_url: `${process.env.APP_URL}/webhook`,
        },
        order_note: req.body.productinfo,
    });
    // Ship the SHORT-LIVED session token to the client — NOT key/salt/hash.
    res.json({
        orderId,
        paymentSessionId: response.data.payment_session_id,
    });
});

// Verify — do NOT verify a client-side hash. Re-fetch order status from the backend.
app.get("/verify/:orderId", async (req, res) => {
    const order = await cashfree.PGFetchOrder(req.params.orderId);
    if (order.data.order_status === "PAID") {
        fulfillOrder(req.params.orderId);
        return res.json({ status: "PAID" });
    }
    res.json({ status: order.data.order_status }); // ACTIVE / EXPIRED / TERMINATED
});

// Refund — keyed by order_id, not mihpayid; no command/hash
await cashfree.PGOrderCreateRefund(orderId, {
    refund_id: `refund_${Date.now()}`, // you generate it
    refund_amount: refundAmountRupees, // RUPEES
    refund_note: "Customer request",
});
```

**Key rewrites:**
- **Delete the hash helpers** (request hash, reverse hash, and the `key|command|var1|salt` command hash). Cashfree auth is header-based via the SDK — there is no SHA-512 to compute on order create, verify, or refund.
- Replace the `surl` + `furl` **pair** with a single `order_meta.return_url` (Cashfree returns there for both success and failure — you re-fetch to learn the outcome). Set `notify_url` for the webhook.
- Replace the reverse-hash `/payu/success` check with a **backend re-fetch** (`PGFetchOrder` / `GET /pg/orders/{order_id}`). Fulfil **only** on `order_status === "PAID"`.
- Provide `customer_id` and `customer_phone` on order creation. Both are **required** by Cashfree; PayU only required `firstname`/`email`/`phone` loosely.
- Reuse your `txnid` as `order_id` if its format fits (alphanumeric + `-_`, ≤50 chars). Generate your own `refund_id` (PayU's `mihpayid`/`token` model goes away).

### Step 5 — Replace the checkout (form post / Bolt)

PayU either **auto-submits a form to `_payment`** (full redirect) or opens the **Bolt** modal with `key`+`hash`+fields. Cashfree uses **`payment_session_id`** via Cashfree.js or Drop-in — no key/salt/hash is sent to the browser.

**Before (PayU Bolt):**
```html
<script src="https://jssdk.payu.in/bolt/bolt.min.js"></script>
<script>
// fields + hash come from /create-order (hash computed server-side)
bolt.launch({
    key, txnid, amount, productinfo, firstname, email, phone,
    surl, furl, hash,
    udf1: "", udf2: "", udf3: "", udf4: "", udf5: "",
}, {
    responseHandler: function (BOLT) {
        // BOLT.response.txnStatus -> "SUCCESS" | "FAILED" | "CANCEL"
        fetch("/payu/verify?txnid=" + txnid);
    },
    catchException: function (BOLT) { console.error(BOLT.message); },
});
</script>
```

**After (Cashfree.js / Drop-in):**
```html
<script src="https://sdk.cashfree.com/js/v3/cashfree.js"></script>
<script>
const cashfree = Cashfree({ mode: "sandbox" }); // or "production"
cashfree
    .checkout({
        paymentSessionId: paymentSessionId,   // from /create-order — that's all the client needs
        redirectTarget: "_self",              // redirects to return_url on completion
    })
    .then(async (result) => {
        if (result.error) return console.error(result.error);
        // The backend MUST re-fetch order status — don't trust `result` (or any client signal) alone.
        const r = await fetch(`/verify/${orderId}`).then((r) => r.json());
        if (r.status === "PAID") /* show success */;
    });
</script>
```

Full option-by-option JS translation (Bolt `responseHandler`/`catchException` → `.then(result)`, `udf*` → `order_tags`, Drop-in, themes) lives in `references/REFERENCE.md` §3.

### Step 6 — Rewrite webhooks

PayU's webhook/S2S callback is `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and is authenticated by **re-computing the same SHA-512 reverse hash** over the posted fields. Cashfree uses an **HMAC signature header** over `timestamp + rawBody`.

**Before (PayU S2S — hash verify):**
```javascript
app.post("/payu/webhook", express.urlencoded({ extended: true }), (req, res) => {
    const p = req.body; // status, mihpayid, txnid, amount, hash, ...
    const reverse =
        `${process.env.PAYU_MERCHANT_SALT}|${p.status}|||||||||||${p.email}|${p.firstname}|${p.productinfo}|${p.amount}|${p.txnid}|${process.env.PAYU_MERCHANT_KEY}`;
    const expected = crypto.createHash("sha512").update(reverse).digest("hex");
    if (expected !== p.hash) return res.sendStatus(400);
    if (p.status === "success") handleSuccess(p);
    else handleFailure(p); // failure OR pending -> non-success
    res.sendStatus(200);
});
```

**After (Cashfree):**
```javascript
app.post("/webhook",
    express.raw({ type: "application/json" }),   // RAW body, not urlencoded
    (req, res) => {
        const timestamp = req.headers["x-webhook-timestamp"];
        const signature = req.headers["x-webhook-signature"];
        const expected = crypto
            .createHmac("sha256", process.env.CASHFREE_SECRET_KEY) // HMAC-SHA256, not plain SHA-512
            .update(timestamp + req.body.toString())               // timestamp + raw body
            .digest("base64");                                     // BASE64, not hex
        if (expected !== signature) return res.sendStatus(400);

        const event = JSON.parse(req.body.toString());
        switch (event.type) {
            case "PAYMENT_SUCCESS_WEBHOOK":       handleSuccess(event.data);    break;
            case "PAYMENT_FAILED_WEBHOOK":        handleFailure(event.data);    break;
            case "PAYMENT_USER_DROPPED_WEBHOOK":  handleDropped(event.data);    break;
            case "REFUND_STATUS_WEBHOOK":         handleRefund(event.data);     break;
            case "SETTLEMENT_SUCCESS":            handleSettlement(event.data); break;
            // other settlement events: SETTLEMENT_INITIATED / SETTLEMENT_FAILED / SETTLEMENT_REVERSED
        }
        res.sendStatus(200); // always 200, always quickly; process async if slow
    });
```

**Three things change at once** (this is the #1 source of post-migration webhook bugs): the algorithm (`SHA-512 hash` → `HMAC-SHA256`), the input (`fields` → `timestamp + rawBody`), and the encoding (`hex` → `base64`). A PayU verifier with the secret swapped will **always** fail against Cashfree.

**Event-name map (most common):**

| PayU signal | → | Cashfree event |
|---|---|---|
| callback `status = success` | → | `PAYMENT_SUCCESS_WEBHOOK` |
| callback `status = failure` | → | `PAYMENT_FAILED_WEBHOOK` |
| `unmappedstatus = userCancelled` / abandonment | → | `PAYMENT_USER_DROPPED_WEBHOOK` |
| refund S2S / `cancel_refund_transaction` result | → | `REFUND_STATUS_WEBHOOK` (check `data.refund.refund_status`) |
| settlement report | → | `SETTLEMENT_SUCCESS` (also `SETTLEMENT_INITIATED` / `SETTLEMENT_FAILED` / `SETTLEMENT_REVERSED`) |
| dispute / chargeback notification | → | `DISPUTE_*` events (see `pg/disputes/SKILL.md`) |
| SI / mandate events | → | See `subscriptions/SKILL.md` (different event names) |

**Configure webhooks:** Cashfree Dashboard → Developers → Webhooks → add endpoint for each environment. Subscribe to the specific events above. Whitelist Cashfree's IPs so your firewall doesn't drop calls:

| Environment | IPs |
|---|---|
| Sandbox | `52.66.25.127`, `15.206.45.168` |
| Production | `52.66.101.190`, `3.109.102.144`, `18.60.134.245`, `18.60.183.142` |

### Step 7 — Parallel-run, then cut over

Do not flip 100% of traffic on day 1.

1. **Dual-deploy in sandbox.** Keep both integrations wired, pick provider via a feature flag (`PAYMENT_PROVIDER=payu|cashfree`). Run Cashfree end-to-end with test cards/VPAs (see `pg/apis/SKILL.md` §5).
2. **Smoke-test webhook delivery** in the Cashfree Dashboard → Developers → Webhooks → Logs tab. Replay a successful order to prove your handler is idempotent.
3. **Shadow in production.** Move 5–10% of traffic to Cashfree via the feature flag. Watch both dashboards for conversion and failure parity — and re-confirm the `pending`/`PENDING` state machine, since PayU and Cashfree treat it differently.
4. **Ramp to 100%.** Once parity holds, flip the flag. Leave the PayU code path dormant for 30 days to handle delayed webhooks (refunds, settlements, disputes) on pre-cutover transactions.
5. **Decommission.** Remove PayU SDK/env vars/hash helpers/endpoints. Archive PayU dashboard settlements and reconcile.

The full go-live checklist (domain whitelisting, `x-api-version` pinning, TLS 1.2, production integrity checks on Android) lives in `pg/go-live/SKILL.md` — run through it before Step 4.

## 4. Security Constraints — Never Violate

These rules are what break PayU→Cashfree migrations most often:

1. **Never send `x-client-secret` to the client.** With PayU the browser saw `key` + a precomputed `hash`; with Cashfree the client gets **only** the `payment_session_id`. The secret stays on the server, in headers, on server-to-server calls.
2. **Never trust a client-side success signal.** PayU anchored trust on the reverse hash; Cashfree's equivalent is the **backend re-fetch** (`PGFetchOrder` / `GET /pg/orders/{order_id}`). Fulfil **only** when `order_status === "PAID"` — not on `BOLT.response.txnStatus`, not on `result` from `.checkout()`.
3. **Webhook = HMAC-SHA256, base64, over `timestamp + rawBody`.** Not plain `SHA-512`, not hex, not over the field list. Use the **raw** request body and prepend `x-webhook-timestamp`. Forgetting the timestamp is the #1 signature bug for PayU migrants.
4. **Re-model `pending`.** PayU told you to treat `pending` as failed at callback time. Cashfree's `PENDING` means "not terminal yet — keep polling / wait for the webhook". Do not auto-fail Cashfree `PENDING` payments.

## 5. Quick Diagnostic — "My migration broke"

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `401 authentication_error` | Still building a SHA-512 hash / posting `key`+`salt` | Use the SDK, or send `x-client-id` / `x-client-secret` / `x-api-version` headers. Delete the hash code |
| Order create rejected on amount | Passing `"500.00"` string or multiplying anything | Send `order_amount: 500.00` as a **number**; PayU and Cashfree are both rupees, so no `*100` |
| Webhook signature always fails | Reusing PayU's SHA-512/hex/field-list hash | Switch to `HMAC-SHA256` → `base64` over `x-webhook-timestamp + rawBody` with `CASHFREE_SECRET_KEY` |
| Client shows "successful" but backend never fulfils | Trusting `BOLT.response` / `.checkout()` result like the old reverse-hash trust | Call `PGFetchOrder` / `GET /orders/{id}` from the backend; only fulfil on `PAID` |
| `customer_id_missing` / `customer_phone_missing` | PayU treated customer fields loosely | Add both as required fields in `customer_details` |
| `400 version_missing` | No `x-api-version` | Add `x-api-version: 2025-01-01` (SDK handles this automatically) |
| Refunds fail with "not found" | Calling refund by `mihpayid` / `token` | Use your merchant `order_id` — `POST /pg/orders/{order_id}/refunds` with a fresh `refund_id` |
| Payments stuck "failed" that PayU would have shown processing | Auto-failing Cashfree `PENDING` (PayU treated pending as failed) | Treat `PENDING` as non-terminal; poll `PGFetchOrder` / wait for webhook |
| Two `return_url`s needed | Looking for `surl`/`furl` split | Cashfree has **one** `return_url`; the backend re-fetch decides success vs failure |
| Webhooks never arrive | Firewall rules, or expecting urlencoded | Whitelist Cashfree IPs (Step 6); parse **raw JSON**, not form-urlencoded |

Cross-reference `common-mistakes/SKILL.md` for all other debugging — it's gateway-agnostic and applies equally to post-migration issues.

## 6. After This Skill — Follow-up Reading

Once the mapping is clear, these are the skills to read next in order:

1. `pg/backend-sdks/SKILL.md` — idiomatic per-language SDK patterns (or `pg/apis/SKILL.md` if the project will use raw HTTP).
2. `pg/webhooks/SKILL.md` — full signature-verification reference and event payload schemas.
3. `pg/web-sdk/SKILL.md` or `pg/mobile-sdks/SKILL.md` — checkout rewrite (Bolt → Cashfree.js, CheckoutPro → Cashfree mobile SDK).
4. `pg/go-live/SKILL.md` — production checklist, domain whitelisting, integrity checks.
5. `validation-and-testing/SKILL.md` — post-integration test matrix (run this after every step above).
6. `common-mistakes/SKILL.md` — diagnostic companion during the parallel-run period.

For product areas that need their own mapping:

- **SI / Standing Instructions / recurring → Subscriptions:** `subscriptions/SKILL.md` + this skill's REFERENCE §7.
- **Saved cards (PayU-managed → Cashfree):** `pg/token-vault/SKILL.md` (instruments are **not** portable; rebuild for new traffic).
- **Mobile SDKs (PayU CheckoutPro Android/iOS/RN/Flutter):** `pg/mobile-sdks/SKILL.md` + this skill's REFERENCE §8.
- **Hosted payment links (PayU Payment Links):** `pg/payment-links/SKILL.md`.
