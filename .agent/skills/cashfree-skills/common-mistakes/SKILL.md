# Cashfree Payment Gateway — Common Integration Mistakes & Pitfalls

---

## 1. Scope & Boundaries

### When to use this skill

- The developer is **debugging a failed or broken integration** — payments failing, webhooks not arriving, signature mismatches, SDK errors, unexpected API responses.
- The developer is asking **"why isn't this working?"** or **"what am I doing wrong?"** in the context of a Cashfree Payment Gateway integration.
- The developer is preparing to **go live** and wants a pre-launch checklist to catch common issues.
- The developer wants to understand **best practices** for security, reliability, and error handling across any Cashfree integration type (Backend SDK, Mobile SDK, S2S REST API, Web Checkout).

### When NOT to use this skill

- If the developer needs **step-by-step integration instructions** — use the Backend SDK, Mobile SDK, S2S REST API, or Web Checkout skill instead. This skill diagnoses problems; those skills build integrations.
- If the question is about **Payouts**, **Subscriptions/Recurring**, **Verification Suite**, or **Secure ID** — those products have their own error handling and troubleshooting patterns.
- If the developer needs help with **Cashfree Dashboard configuration only** (no code) — this skill is not the right fit.

## 2. Structural Overview

### How This Skill Is Organized

This skill covers mistakes across **six categories**, matching the layers of a typical Cashfree integration:

| Category | What It Covers |
|---|---|
| **A. Security & Credentials** | Secret key exposure, credential misconfiguration, environment mismatches |
| **B. Order Creation** | Missing required fields, invalid amounts, API version issues |
| **C. Payment Verification** | Trusting frontend callbacks, not checking order status, race conditions |
| **D. Webhook Integration** | Signature mismatches, missed webhooks, duplicate processing, IP whitelisting |
| **E. Mobile SDK** | Callback timing, iOS configuration, Expo/Capacitor issues, Cashfree Integrity |
| **F. Rate Limits & Production Readiness** | Throttling, go-live checklist, domain whitelisting |
| **G. Payouts — IP & Signature Auth** | Multiple account IP mismatch, dynamic IP, signature expiry |

Each mistake follows the format: **What goes wrong → Why it happens → How to fix it**.

---

## 3. Category A: Security & Credential Mistakes

### A1. Exposing `x-client-secret` in frontend or mobile code

**What goes wrong:** The secret key is embedded in JavaScript bundles, mobile app binaries, or client-side code. Attackers extract it and make unauthorized API calls (create fake orders, initiate refunds, access payment data).

**Why it happens:** Developers call `POST /orders` directly from the browser or mobile app instead of routing through their backend.

**How to fix it:**
- **NEVER** include `x-client-secret` in any client-side code — browser JS, React/Vue/Angular bundles, Android/iOS apps, React Native, Flutter, or Cordova.
- Create orders exclusively from your backend server.
- The mobile/web SDK authenticates via `payment_session_id` (a short-lived token), not API keys.
- Store credentials in environment variables or a secrets manager, never hardcoded in source code or committed to version control.

---

### A2. Using sandbox credentials in production (or vice versa)

**What goes wrong:** API calls return `authentication_error` (401) or orders are created in the wrong environment. Payments appear to succeed in sandbox but fail in production.

**Why it happens:** Developers forget to switch credentials and base URLs when deploying.

**How to fix it:**
- Sandbox and production use **different** `x-client-id` / `x-client-secret` pairs and **different** base URLs.
- Use environment variables to manage this:

| Environment | Base URL | SDK Constant |
|---|---|---|
| Sandbox | `https://sandbox.cashfree.com/pg` | `Cashfree.Environment.SANDBOX` |
| Production | `https://api.cashfree.com/pg` | `Cashfree.Environment.PRODUCTION` |

- Never hardcode the environment — derive it from a config variable (`NODE_ENV`, `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`, etc.).

---

### A3. Hardcoding credentials in source code

**What goes wrong:** Credentials end up in Git repositories, CI/CD logs, or Docker images. Even private repos can be compromised.

**Why it happens:** Quick prototyping habits carry over to production code.

**How to fix it:**
- Use environment variables: `process.env.CASHFREE_APP_ID` (Node.js), `os.environ["CASHFREE_APP_ID"]` (Python), etc.
- Use a secrets manager (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, GCP Secret Manager) for production.
- Add `.env` files to `.gitignore`.
- Rotate credentials immediately if they've been committed to version control.

---

### A4. Not whitelisting your domain in Merchant Dashboard

**What goes wrong:** Checkout pages fail to load or return CORS/domain errors in production.

**Why it happens:** Domain whitelisting is a Merchant Dashboard configuration step that's easy to overlook.

**How to fix it:**
- Log in to the [Merchant Dashboard](https://merchant.cashfree.com).
- Navigate to Payment Gateway > Settings.
- Add your production domain(s) to the whitelist.
- Websites must include policy pages (Contact Us, Terms and Conditions, Refunds and Cancellations) to qualify for whitelisting.
- The review process takes up to 24 hours.

---

## 4. Category B: Order Creation Mistakes

### B1. Missing required fields in `POST /orders`

**What goes wrong:** API returns `400 Bad Request` with error codes like `customer_id_missing`, `customer_phone_missing`, or `order_amount_invalid`.

**Why it happens:** Developers omit required fields or pass them in the wrong format.

**How to fix it:** These four fields are **always required**:

| Field | Type | Rules |
|---|---|---|
| `order_amount` | float | Must be > 0, max 1,000,000 |
| `order_currency` | string | e.g., `"INR"` |
| `customer_details.customer_id` | string | Unique customer identifier |
| `customer_details.customer_phone` | string | Valid 10-digit Indian phone number |

---

### B2. Invalid or missing `x-api-version` header

**What goes wrong:** API returns `version_missing` (400) or returns responses in an unexpected format.

**Why it happens:** The header is omitted, misspelled, or set to an outdated version.

**How to fix it:**
- Always include `x-api-version: 2025-01-01` (latest) in every API call.
- In SDK calls, pass `"2025-01-01"` as the first parameter to every method.
- Use the same version consistently across all API calls and webhook configurations.

---

### B3. Not storing `payment_session_id` after order creation

**What goes wrong:** The developer creates an order but doesn't persist the `payment_session_id`, so they can't proceed to checkout.

**Why it happens:** The response is logged but not stored, or the frontend/mobile app doesn't receive it.

**How to fix it:**
- After calling `POST /orders` (or `PGCreateOrder`), extract and store both `payment_session_id` and `order_id`.
- Send both values to your frontend/mobile app via your own API response.
- `payment_session_id` is required for the Order Pay API (S2S) and for all mobile/web SDK checkout flows.

---

### B4. Order amount exceeds maximum

**What goes wrong:** API returns `order_amount_invalid` (400).

**Why it happens:** The amount exceeds the 1,000,000 limit.

**How to fix it:** Keep `order_amount` at or below 1,000,000. For larger amounts, contact Cashfree support.

---

## 5. Category C: Payment Verification Mistakes

### C1. Fulfilling orders based on frontend callbacks alone

**What goes wrong:** Orders are fulfilled for payments that actually failed, are pending, or were spoofed. This is the **single most dangerous mistake** in any payment integration.

**Why it happens:** Developers treat the `return_url` redirect, the `onVerify` mobile SDK callback, or the Checkout JS `onSuccess` callback as proof of payment.

**How to fix it:**
- **ALWAYS** verify payment status from your backend by calling `GET /orders/{order_id}` (or `PGFetchOrder`).
- Only fulfill when `order_status` is `"PAID"`.
- Frontend callbacks and return URLs are **hints**, not guarantees. They can be spoofed, arrive out of order, or fail to fire.
- Implement a dual-verification approach: check both the backend API response AND the webhook notification.

**Order status values:**

| Status | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `PAID` | Payment succeeded | Safe to fulfill |
| `ACTIVE` | Awaiting payment | Do NOT fulfill |
| `EXPIRED` | Order expired | Do NOT fulfill |

---

### C2. Not handling all payment status values

**What goes wrong:** The application only checks for `SUCCESS` and ignores other states, leading to stuck orders or incorrect user messaging.

**Why it happens:** Developers only test the happy path.

**How to fix it:** Handle all payment-level statuses:

| Status | What to Do |
|---|---|
| `SUCCESS` | Fulfill the order |
| `FAILED` | Show failure message, allow retry |
| `PENDING` | Show "processing" message, poll or wait for webhook |
| `NOT_ATTEMPTED` | User hasn't tried paying yet |
| `USER_DROPPED` | User abandoned checkout — send a reminder or allow retry |
| `CANCELLED` | Amount reversed — do not fulfill |
| `VOID` | Pre-auth not captured — do not fulfill |

> The full `payment_status` enum is `SUCCESS`, `NOT_ATTEMPTED`, `FAILED`, `USER_DROPPED`, `VOID`, `CANCELLED`, `PENDING`. There is no `FLAGGED` status.

---

### C3. Race condition between return URL and webhook

**What goes wrong:** The user lands on the return URL before the webhook arrives, or the webhook arrives before the return URL handler runs. The application shows inconsistent status.

**Why it happens:** Webhooks and return URL redirects are asynchronous and independent.

**How to fix it:**
- Design your system so that **either** the return URL handler **or** the webhook can trigger fulfillment — whichever arrives first.
- Use your database as the source of truth. Both the return URL handler and the webhook handler should call `GET /orders/{order_id}` and update the same order record.
- Implement idempotency so processing the same order twice is safe.

---

### C4. Branching on error message strings instead of error codes

**What goes wrong:** Code compares against the human-readable failure text — e.g. `if (error_description === "Your card was declined by the bank")` or `if (msg.includes("insufficient funds"))`. The message wording then changes in a later API/SDK version (or differs by issuer/locale), the comparison silently stops matching, and the failure-handling branch (retry, fallback mode, user messaging) breaks in production with no error thrown.

**Why it happens:** The description string is the most visible field in the response, so developers reach for it. The machine-readable `error_code` looks less friendly and gets ignored.

**How to fix it:** Branch **only** on the stable, machine-readable fields. Treat description text as display-only — log it, show it to the user, but never make a control-flow decision on it.

A payment failure carries four `error_details` fields. Three are stable, machine-readable contract; one is free text:

| Field | Use for control flow? | Example values |
|---|---|---|
| `error_code` | ✅ yes — precise code | `issuer_declined`, `instrument_id_expired`, `cryptogram_expired` |
| `error_reason` | ✅ yes — category | `bank_declined`, `insufficient_funds` |
| `error_source` | ✅ yes — origin | `bank`, `cashfree`, `user` |
| `error_description` | ❌ **no** — display/log only | "Card issuer did not support tokenization" |

```js
// ❌ Fragile — breaks the moment Cashfree rewords the message
if (err?.error_description?.includes("declined")) { ... }

// ✅ Stable — error_code / error_reason / error_source are part of the API contract
const err = payment.error_details;
if (err?.error_reason === "insufficient_funds") { suggestLowerAmount(); }
else if (err?.error_code === "issuer_declined")  { promptRetryDifferentCard(); }
else if (err?.error_source === "user")           { allowRetry(); }      // user-side, retryable
// error_description is for the UI / logs only:
log.info(err?.error_description);
```

> Full decline-code catalog: `pg/apis/references/REFERENCE.md` §5, and the official list at https://www.cashfree.com/docs/api-reference/payments/errors.

Apply the same rule to every status-like field:

| Branch on (stable, contracted) | Never branch on (display-only, mutable) |
|---|---|
| `order_status`, `payment_status`, `transaction_status` | any "*_message" / "*_description" / "*_note" |
| `error_details.error_code`, `error_reason`, `error_source` | `error_details.error_description` |
| refund `refund_status`, dispute `dispute_status` | reason / remarks free-text |
| webhook `type` + the typed `error_code` | webhook human-readable summary text |

Rule of thumb: **codes and enums are the contract; descriptions are documentation.** If you find yourself string-matching a description, there is almost always a code field carrying the same signal — use that instead. This also keeps your integration forward-compatible across API-version and SDK upgrades.

---

## 6. Category D: Webhook Mistakes

### D1. Webhook signature verification fails (signature mismatch)

**What goes wrong:** Your signature verification code always returns `false`, even for legitimate Cashfree webhooks.

**Why it happens (most common causes):**

1. **Using parsed JSON instead of raw body.** This is the #1 cause. When you parse the JSON body and re-serialize it, decimal values change (e.g., `170.00` → `170`), field ordering changes, or whitespace changes — all of which break the signature.
2. **Using the wrong secret key.** Sandbox and production have different keys.
3. **Middleware parsing the body before your handler.** Express `body-parser`, Django middleware, Spring Boot auto-deserialization, etc.

**How to fix it:**
- **Always use the raw request body** (the exact bytes received) for signature verification.
- In Express.js: use `express.raw({ type: "application/json" })` on the webhook route, NOT `express.json()`.
- In Flask: use `request.data.decode('utf-8')`, not `request.json`.
- In Java/Spring Boot: read from `HttpServletRequest.getReader()`, not from a `@RequestBody` parameter.
- In PHP: use `file_get_contents('php://input')`.
- Use the SDK's built-in `PGVerifyWebhookSignature` method when available — it handles this correctly.

**Verification process:**
1. Extract `x-webhook-timestamp` from headers.
2. Concatenate: `timestamp + rawBody`.
3. Generate HMAC-SHA256 hash using your `x-client-secret`.
4. Base64-encode the hash.
5. Compare with `x-webhook-signature` header.

---

### D2. Webhooks not being received at all

**What goes wrong:** Your webhook endpoint never gets called by Cashfree.

**Why it happens:**

1. **The webhook endpoint is not configured.** You haven't added it in Dashboard > Developers > Webhooks.
2. **The required event is not subscribed.** You configured the URL but didn't select the specific events (e.g., `PAYMENT_SUCCESS_WEBHOOK`).
3. **The endpoint returns a 500 error or doesn't respond.** Cashfree's test POST during setup fails.
4. **Firewall blocks Cashfree's IPs.** Your server rejects requests from Cashfree's IP addresses.
5. **The endpoint is not publicly accessible.** Localhost, private networks, or VPN-only URLs won't work.

**How to fix it:**
- Configure webhooks in Dashboard > Developers > Webhooks > Add Webhook Endpoint.
- Subscribe to the specific events you need.
- Ensure your endpoint is publicly accessible over HTTPS.
- Whitelist Cashfree's IPs:

| Environment | IPs |
|---|---|
| Sandbox | `52.66.25.127`, `15.206.45.168` |
| Production | `52.66.101.190`, `3.109.102.144`, `18.60.134.245`, `18.60.183.142` |

- Port: 443 (HTTPS only).
- Check webhook logs in Dashboard > Developers > Webhooks > Logs tab.
- Use "Batch Resend" in the dashboard to resend missed webhook events.

---

### D3. Processing duplicate webhook events

**What goes wrong:** The same payment is fulfilled twice, refunds are doubled, or inventory is decremented multiple times.

**Why it happens:**
- Cashfree retries webhooks when your endpoint returns a non-200 response or times out.
- Server downtime causes retries.
- Multiple webhook subscriptions to the same event across different URLs or versions.

**How to fix it:**
- **Implement idempotency.** Use the `x-idempotency-key` header (available in webhook versions from 2025-01-01) to deduplicate. Store processed webhook IDs and skip duplicates.
- **Always return HTTP 200** immediately upon receiving a webhook, even if you process it asynchronously.
- Check for duplicate event subscriptions in Dashboard > Developers > Webhooks — remove any redundant configurations.
- Design your fulfillment logic to be idempotent: processing the same event twice should have no additional effect.

---

### D4. Not returning HTTP 200 from webhook endpoint

**What goes wrong:** Cashfree keeps retrying the webhook, causing duplicate deliveries and potential rate limiting.

**Why it happens:** The endpoint throws an unhandled exception, returns a 500, or takes too long to respond.

**How to fix it:**
- Return HTTP 200 **immediately** after receiving and validating the webhook.
- Process the webhook payload **asynchronously** (queue it for background processing) if your business logic takes time.
- Wrap your webhook handler in a try-catch to prevent unhandled exceptions from returning 500s.

---

### D5. Webhook endpoint not using HTTPS

**What goes wrong:** Cashfree rejects the endpoint or webhook data is transmitted insecurely.

**Why it happens:** Development environments often use HTTP.

**How to fix it:**
- All webhook endpoints **must** use HTTPS in production.
- Use a valid SSL certificate (Let's Encrypt is free).
- For local development, use a tunneling tool (ngrok, localtunnel) that provides HTTPS.

---

## 7. Category E: Mobile SDK Mistakes

### E1. Setting callback AFTER calling `doPayment()`

**What goes wrong:** The callback is never fired. The app doesn't receive the payment result. The user sees a blank screen or gets stuck.

**Why it happens:** The developer calls `doPayment()` before registering the callback.

**How to fix it:**
- **Always register the callback BEFORE calling `doPayment()`.**
- Register in the correct lifecycle method:

| Platform | Where to Register |
|---|---|
| Android | `onCreate()` |
| iOS | `viewDidLoad()` |
| Flutter | `initState()` |
| React Native | `componentDidMount()` |
| Cordova | `onDeviceReady()` |

---

### E2. Callback lost on activity/view restart (Android)

**What goes wrong:** After screen rotation or the OS killing the activity in the background, the callback is gone. The payment completes but the app doesn't know.

**Why it happens:** The callback is set in a method that doesn't re-execute on activity recreation.

**How to fix it:**
- Set the callback in `onCreate()`, which runs on every activity creation (including restarts).
- Implement `CFCheckoutResponseCallback` on the Activity class itself.

---

### E3. Missing `LSApplicationQueriesSchemes` in iOS `info.plist`

**What goes wrong:** UPI apps are not detected on iOS. The UPI Intent checkout shows no apps. UPI payments fail silently.

**Why it happens:** iOS requires explicit declaration of URL schemes your app queries.

**How to fix it:** Add to `info.plist`:
```xml
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
<array>
    <string>amazonpay</string>
    <string>upi</string>
    <string>credpay</string>
    <string>bhim</string>
    <string>paytmmp</string>
    <string>phonepe</string>
    <string>tez</string>
    <string>navipay</string>
    <string>mobikwik</string>
    <string>myairtel</string>
    <string>popclubapp</string>
    <string>super</string>
    <string>kiwi</string>
    <string>simplypayupi</string>
    <string>whatsapp</string>
</array>
```

This applies to **all** iOS-targeting SDKs: native iOS, Flutter, React Native, and Cordova.

---

### E4. Using Expo Go instead of a dev client build

**What goes wrong:** The Cashfree SDK crashes or doesn't load in Expo Go.

**Why it happens:** Cashfree's React Native SDK uses native modules that Expo Go doesn't support.

**How to fix it:**
```bash
npx expo prebuild  # mandatory
npx expo run:android
npx expo run:ios
```
Use `expo-dev-client` for development builds, not Expo Go.

---

### E5. Cashfree Integrity blocks production payments (sideloaded APK)

**What goes wrong:** Production payments fail with:
```json
{
  "message": "com.google.android.packageinstaller is not a trusted source. App should be installed from play store or another whitelisted app store.",
  "code": "installer_package_not_approved",
  "type": "feature_not_enabled"
}
```

**Why it happens:** In production, Cashfree verifies that the app was installed from a trusted app store (Google Play, App Store, Samsung Galaxy Store, etc.). Sideloaded APKs fail this check.

**How to fix it:**
1. Upload your app to the **Play Store Internal Testing** track.
2. Create a tester email list in Play Console > Internal Testing > Testers.
3. Share the invitation link with testers.
4. Testers install the app from the Play Store.
5. In **Sandbox**, integrity checks always pass — this only affects production.

**Affected SDKs:** Android, React Native, Flutter, Cordova, Ionic, Capacitor.

---

### E6. Not running `pod install --repo-update` after adding iOS dependencies

**What goes wrong:** iOS build fails with "module not found" or "no such module" errors.

**Why it happens:** CocoaPods cache is stale or the new dependency isn't resolved.

**How to fix it:**
```bash
cd ios
pod install --repo-update
```
Run this after every dependency change for Flutter, React Native, and Cordova iOS builds.

---

### E7. Using the Cordova plugin under Capacitor

**What goes wrong:** The Cordova plugin doesn't work cleanly with Capacitor.

**Why it happens:** `cordova-plugin-cashfree-pg` is built for Cordova. Capacitor (7+) has its own dedicated plugin.

**How to fix it:**
```bash
# For Capacitor 7+ — use the dedicated Capacitor plugin
npm install capacitor-plugin-cashfree-pg cashfree-pg-api-contract
npx cap sync

# NOT this (this is for Cordova only):
npm install cordova-plugin-cashfree-pg
```

---

### E8. Not removing callback in React Native `componentWillUnmount`

**What goes wrong:** Memory leak. Stale callbacks may fire on unmounted components, causing React Native warnings or crashes.

**How to fix it:**
```typescript
componentWillUnmount() {
  CFPaymentGatewayService.removeCallback();
}
```

---

## 7.5. Category E.5: Web SDK — checkout result handling & init mistakes

### E.5.1. Treating `result.error` from `cashfree.checkout({ redirectTarget: "_modal" })` as "payment failed"

**What goes wrong:** App toasts "Payment failed. Please try again." every time the user closes the Cashfree modal — even when they just changed their mind.

**Why it happens:** `result.error` fires for **three** things: SDK errors, network errors, AND the user dismissing the modal. The code treated it as a single failure signal.

**Fix:** Handle all three resolution states. `result.error` → "Payment was not completed" (neutral), `result.redirect` → the page is navigating (stop), `result.paymentDetails` → an attempt was made (backend-verify before fulfilling). See `pg/web-sdk/SKILL.md` §3 for the full pattern.

### E.5.2. Mounting Cashfree Elements then calling `cashfree.checkout()` to "submit"

**What goes wrong:** App mounts `cardNumber` / `cardCvv` / `cardExpiry` / `cardHolder`. On submit, it calls `cashfree.checkout({ redirectTarget: "_modal" })`. A Drop-in modal opens that **ignores the card form the user just filled in**.

**Why it happens:** The two paths (Drop-in vs Elements) are mutually exclusive but look similar to AI agents and the docs sometimes show both in the same file.

**Fix:** Elements forms **must** submit via `cashfree.pay({ paymentMethod: cardNumber, paymentSessionId })`. `cashfree.checkout()` is for Drop-in only. See the Web SDK decision matrix in `pg/web-sdk/SKILL.md` §2.

### E.5.3. Initializing `Cashfree({ mode })` inside a click handler

**What goes wrong:** A new SDK instance is created on every checkout click. Memory grows, instance state is lost, certain SDK features (event listeners, saved-card cache) behave inconsistently between attempts.

**Fix:** Call `Cashfree({ mode })` **once** at module / page load. The returned instance is reusable across multiple `.checkout()` / `.pay()` calls.

### E.5.4. Dead `?order_id` redirect-handler in a `_modal`-only app

**What goes wrong:** A `DOMContentLoaded` listener reads `?order_id` from the URL and calls `verifyOrder`. The app uses `redirectTarget: "_modal"` everywhere — Cashfree never navigates the browser, so this block is unreachable.

**Fix:** Delete it. The block is only needed for `_self` / `_top` redirect modes. Leaving it in misleads future maintainers (and AI agents) into thinking two flows are supported when only one is.

---

## 7.6. Category E.6: Backend SDK — legacy version-arg & `return_url` traps

### E.6.1. Inconsistent `x_api_version` in the legacy version-first style

**What goes wrong:**

```python
cashfree_client.PGCreateOrder('2025-01-01', payload)   # ok
cashfree_client.PGFetchOrder(order_id)                  # ❌ missing version
```

**Why it happens:** In the static/legacy call style, the SDK requires the version as the first positional arg on **every** method. AI agents often apply it to `PGCreateOrder` and forget the rest.

**Fix:** Pick **one** style per client. Either pass `'2025-01-01'` first on **every** method (static/legacy style), or use the instance style (`new Cashfree(env, id, secret)`) and omit the version everywhere. Mixing the two is the most common migration bug. See `pg/backend-sdks/SKILL.md` §2.

### E.6.2. `return_url` with literal `{order_id}` inside a Python f-string

**What goes wrong:**

```python
return_url = f"http://localhost:{PORT}/return/{{order_id}}"
# Sent to Cashfree: http://localhost:5000/return/{order_id}  (literal braces)
# Flask route /return/<order_id> tries to match the string "{order_id}" as the path param → 404 / wrong handler
```

**Why it happens:** `{order_id}` is a Cashfree server-side substitution token. Inside a Python f-string, `{...}` is also interpolation syntax. Escaping as `{{order_id}}` produces a literal `{order_id}` in the URL — which Flask's route converter then can't match.

**Fix:** Use a **static** `return_url` (`https://yoursite.com/return`) — Cashfree appends `?order_id=ORDER_ID` automatically. Read it on the handler with `request.args.get('order_id')`. Avoid the `{order_id}` token unless you really want server-side substitution, and never wrap it in an f-string. See `pg/backend-sdks/SKILL.md` §4 Step 1.

---

## 8. Category F: Rate Limits & Production Readiness

### F1. Hitting rate limits (429 Too Many Requests)

**What goes wrong:** API returns `429 Too Many Requests`. Payments fail during peak traffic.

**Why it happens:** Your application exceeds the per-minute request limits.

**Production rate limits:**

| API | Limit/min | Type |
|---|---|---|
| Create Order | 200 | Account |
| Get Order | 400 | Account |
| Pay Order | 100 | IP |
| Get Payments | 100 | Account |
| Get Payment by ID | 130 | Account |
| Get Settlements | 30 | Account |
| Initiate Refund | 100 | Account |
| Get Refund | 30 | Account |

**Sandbox limits are lower** (e.g., Create Order: 30/min).

**How to fix it:**
- Implement **exponential backoff** for retries.
- Monitor rate limit response headers: `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `X-RateLimit-Reset`.
- Cache responses where applicable (e.g., don't poll `GET /orders` every second).
- For UPI collect/bank transfer polling, use 3–5 second intervals, not faster.
- Request rate limit increases via Merchant Dashboard > Payment Gateway > Developers > Rate Limits, or contact your account manager.

---

### F2. Polling too frequently for async payment status

**What goes wrong:** Rate limits are hit. The application gets throttled.

**Why it happens:** Developers poll `GET /orders/{order_id}/payments` every 500ms for UPI collect or bank transfer status.

**How to fix it:**
- Poll every **3–5 seconds**, not faster.
- Stop polling when you receive a terminal status: `SUCCESS`, `FAILED`, or `USER_DROPPED`.
- Better yet, rely on **webhooks** as the primary notification mechanism and use polling only as a fallback.

---

### F3. Not setting timeouts on HTTP calls

**What goes wrong:** Your server hangs indefinitely waiting for a Cashfree API response, blocking threads and degrading performance.

**Why it happens:** No timeout configured on the HTTP client.

**How to fix it:**
- Set a **10-second timeout** for the Order Pay API (especially for Native OTP, which depends on bank ACS load time).
- Set a **5–10 second timeout** for all other API calls.
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures.

## 9. Category G: Payouts — IP Whitelisting & Signature Auth Mistakes

### G1. Signature mismatch despite IP being whitelisted (multiple Payout accounts)

**What goes wrong:** The Payout API returns `signature mismatch` or authentication errors even though you've already whitelisted your server's IP.

**Why it happens:** Cashfree Payouts allows merchants to have **multiple Payout accounts**. IP whitelisting is configured **per account**. If you whitelist the IP on Account A but make API calls using the `client_id` / `client_secret` of Account B, authentication fails — the IP is unknown to Account B.

**How to fix it:**
- Log in to the Cashfree Merchant Dashboard for **each Payout account separately**.
- Navigate to Payouts > Settings > IP Whitelisting and whitelist your server IP in **every account** that your API keys belong to.
- Double-check that the `client_id` in your request matches the account where the IP is whitelisted.
- If you have staging and production Payout accounts, whitelist your IPs in both.

### G2. Whitelisting a dynamic IP — IP changes and breaks authentication

**What goes wrong:** Payouts API authentication works initially but then suddenly starts failing with IP-related errors days or weeks later, with no code changes.

**Why it happens:** Two types of IPs exist:
- **Static IP** — fixed, never changes. Required for Cashfree IP whitelisting.
- **Dynamic IP** — assigned by the ISP or cloud provider and can change at any time (common with home internet, shared hosting, or auto-scaled cloud instances without Elastic IP).

The developer whitelisted a dynamic IP that happened to be assigned to their server at that moment. When the IP rotated, Cashfree's whitelist no longer matched the new IP, and authentication started failing.

**How to fix it:**
- Use a **static IP** for any server making Payout API calls.
- On AWS: assign an **Elastic IP** to your EC2 instance or NAT Gateway.
- On GCP: reserve a **static external IP** for your compute resource.
- On Azure: use a **static public IP** address.
- For office networks: contact your ISP to provision a fixed/static IP.
- After getting a static IP, update the whitelist in the Cashfree Payout Dashboard and remove the old dynamic IP entry.

### G3. Payout signature expires — not regenerating within the 10-minute window

**What goes wrong:** Payout API calls start returning authentication errors after the application has been running for a while. The error typically indicates an invalid or expired token/signature.

**Why it happens:** In the Payouts V1 flow, the signature is generated using an **RSA public key** and is valid for only **10 minutes**. If your application generates the signature once at startup (or caches it indefinitely), it expires and all subsequent API calls fail.

**How to fix it:**
- **Regenerate the signature before every API call**, or at most cache it for fewer than 10 minutes.
- In the V1 auth flow: call `POST /payout/v1/authorize` to get a new token regularly.
- Implement a token refresh mechanism — on receiving a `401` or `token_expired` error, re-authenticate immediately before retrying the request.
- Prefer the **V2 Payout API** (direct `client_id` + `client_secret` headers) which does not use a time-limited RSA-signed token.

## 10. Pre-Production Go-Live Checklist

Run through this checklist before switching from sandbox to production:

### Credentials & Environment
- [ ] Production `x-client-id` and `x-client-secret` are configured (not sandbox credentials).
- [ ] SDK environment is set to `PRODUCTION` (not `SANDBOX`).
- [ ] Base URL is `https://api.cashfree.com/pg` (not `https://sandbox.cashfree.com/pg`).
- [ ] Credentials are stored in environment variables or a secrets manager, not hardcoded.
- [ ] `x-client-secret` is NOT present in any frontend or mobile app code.

### Domain & Dashboard
- [ ] Your production domain is whitelisted in Merchant Dashboard.
- [ ] Website includes required policy pages (Contact Us, Terms & Conditions, Refunds & Cancellations).

### Order Creation
- [ ] `x-api-version: 2025-01-01` is set on all API calls.
- [ ] All required fields are provided: `order_amount`, `order_currency`, `customer_details.customer_id`, `customer_details.customer_phone`.
- [ ] `payment_session_id` is stored and passed to frontend/mobile SDK.

### Payment Verification
- [ ] Backend calls `GET /orders/{order_id}` to verify `order_status: "PAID"` before fulfilling.
- [ ] Frontend callbacks (`onVerify`, `onSuccess`, `return_url`) are NOT used as sole proof of payment.
- [ ] All payment statuses are handled (`SUCCESS`, `FAILED`, `PENDING`, `NOT_ATTEMPTED`, `USER_DROPPED`, `CANCELLED`, `VOID`).

### Webhooks
- [ ] Webhook endpoint is configured in Dashboard > Developers > Webhooks.
- [ ] Required events are subscribed (`PAYMENT_SUCCESS_WEBHOOK`, `PAYMENT_FAILED_WEBHOOK`, etc.).
- [ ] Webhook endpoint uses HTTPS.
- [ ] Webhook signature verification is implemented using raw body (not parsed JSON).
- [ ] Cashfree IPs are whitelisted: `52.66.101.190`, `3.109.102.144`, `18.60.134.245`, `18.60.183.142`.
- [ ] Endpoint returns HTTP 200 immediately.
- [ ] Idempotency is implemented to handle duplicate webhook deliveries.

### Mobile SDK (if applicable)
- [ ] iOS `info.plist` includes `LSApplicationQueriesSchemes` for UPI apps.
- [ ] Callbacks are registered in the correct lifecycle method (`onCreate`, `viewDidLoad`, `initState`, `componentDidMount`, `onDeviceReady`).
- [ ] Callbacks are registered BEFORE `doPayment()` is called.
- [ ] For React Native: callback is removed in `componentWillUnmount`.
- [ ] For Expo: `npx expo prebuild` has been run.
- [ ] For production Android testing: app is distributed via Play Store Internal Testing track (not sideloaded).

### Error Handling & Resilience
- [ ] All SDK/API calls are wrapped in try-catch blocks.
- [ ] HTTP timeouts are configured (10s for Order Pay, 5–10s for others).
- [ ] Rate limit headers are monitored; exponential backoff is implemented for retries.
- [ ] Async payment methods (UPI collect, bank transfer) are polled at 3–5 second intervals.
- [ ] All API error responses are logged for debugging and audit trails.

### Security
- [ ] Webhook signature verification is mandatory and implemented.
- [ ] SSL certificate is valid on webhook endpoint.
- [ ] Cashfree Integrity is accounted for (Android production apps installed from trusted stores).
- [ ] 2FA is enabled on Merchant Dashboard account.

## 11. Quick Diagnostic: "My Payment Isn't Working"

Use this decision tree when a developer says "it's not working":

1. **Is the API returning an error?**
   - If `401 authentication_error` → Check credentials. Are you using the right environment's keys? (See A2)
   - If `400 version_missing` → Add `x-api-version: 2025-01-01` header. (See B2)
   - If `400` with a field-specific error → Check required fields. (See B1)
   - If `429 Too Many Requests` → You're rate limited. Implement backoff. (See F1)
   - If `502 bank_processing_failure` → Bank-side issue. Retry or try a different payment method.

2. **Is the order created but checkout doesn't open?**
   - Did you pass `payment_session_id` to the frontend/mobile SDK? (See B3)
   - Is the domain whitelisted? (See A4)
   - Is the SDK environment set correctly? (See A2)

3. **Does checkout open but payment fails?**
   - Check the specific error code in the response.
   - For card payments: Is PCI DSS enabled (S2S only)? Are card details valid?
   - For UPI: Is the VPA valid? Is the expiry within 5–15 minutes?
   - For mobile: Is `LSApplicationQueriesSchemes` configured (iOS)? (See E3)

4. **Payment seems to succeed but order isn't fulfilled?**
   - Are you verifying from the backend? (See C1)
   - Is `order_status` actually `"PAID"`? Check via `GET /orders/{order_id}`.
   - Is there a race condition between return URL and webhook? (See C3)

5. **Webhooks aren't arriving?**
   - Is the endpoint configured in the dashboard? (See D2)
   - Are the right events subscribed?
   - Is the endpoint publicly accessible over HTTPS?
   - Are Cashfree IPs whitelisted? (See D2)
   - Check Dashboard > Developers > Webhooks > Logs.

6. **Webhook signature verification fails?**
   - Are you using the raw body or parsed JSON? (See D1 — this is the #1 cause)
   - Are you using the correct secret key for the environment?
   - Is middleware parsing the body before your handler?

7. **Mobile SDK callback not firing?**
   - Is the callback registered BEFORE `doPayment()`? (See E1)
   - Is it in the correct lifecycle method? (See E1)
   - For React Native: is the callback removed in `componentWillUnmount`? (See E8)

8. **Production payments blocked on Android?**
   - Is the app sideloaded? Use Play Store Internal Testing. (See E5)

9. **Payout API failing with signature mismatch or auth error?**
   - Is your server using a static IP? Dynamic IPs change and break whitelist. (See G2)
   - Do you have multiple Payout accounts? The IP must be whitelisted in the account whose API keys you're using. (See G1)
   - Is the RSA-signed token older than 10 minutes? Regenerate it. (See G3)
