# Cashfree Cross Border — Collect from India Integration

> **References available:** This SKILL.md covers the core integration flow and webhooks. For the full Verification Parameters reference table, Workflow C (submit via order_tags), Workflow D (subscription charges), Workflow E (sandbox testing with test values), and verification details by goods type — read `references/REFERENCE.md` in this directory.

## 1. Scope & Boundaries

### When to use this skill

- The developer is a **foreign merchant** (based outside India) integrating Cashfree to collect payments from **Indian customers** using Indian payment methods (UPI, cards, net banking, virtual accounts).
- The integration involves the **Collect from India** product — Cashfree's PA-CB-compliant imports solution.
- The developer needs guidance on creating orders, uploading payment verification documents (regulatory compliance), checking verification status, handling cross-border-specific webhooks (`PAYMENT_VERIFICATION_UPDATE`, `ICA_SETTLEMENT_UPDATE`), or understanding settlement flows to overseas bank accounts.

### When NOT to use this skill

- If the developer is an **Indian merchant** accepting payments from Indian customers — use the standard Payment Gateway skills.
- If the developer is accepting **international card payments** (Pay in Native Currency / IPG) — that's a different product.
- If the question is about **Payouts**, **Subscriptions**, **Token Vault**, or **Secure ID** — separate products.

## 2. Integration Architecture

### What This Product Does

Cashfree's Collect from India solution enables foreign merchants to:
1. **Collect payments** from Indian customers using Indian payment methods (UPI, cards, net banking, virtual accounts).
2. **Verify transactions** by uploading regulatory compliance documents (importer details, goods descriptions, invoices, HSN codes, shipping details).
3. **Receive settlements** in foreign currency to their overseas bank account.

This is India's first **PA-CB-compliant** (Payment Aggregator - Cross Border) imports solution.

### Flow

```
1. Create Order (standard PG API)
       ↓
2. Collect Payment (Checkout JS / SDK / S2S)
       ↓
3. Upload Verification Details (cross-border-specific — regulatory compliance)
       ↓
4. Verification Review (Cashfree reviews documents)
       ↓
5. Settlement to Overseas Bank Account (in foreign currency)
```

Steps 1–2 are identical to standard Cashfree PG integration. Steps 3–5 are unique to cross-border.

### Core Objects

| Object | Description |
|---|---|
| **Order** | Standard PG order. Created via `POST /pg/orders`. Returns `payment_session_id`. |
| **Payment** | A payment attempt against an order. Identified by `cf_payment_id`. |
| **Verification Details** | Regulatory compliance documents uploaded via `POST /import/transactions/{cf_payment_id}/details`. |
| **Verification Status** | Review status of uploaded documents. Statuses: `ACTION_REQUIRED`, `IN_REVIEW`, `VERIFIED`, `REJECTED`. |
| **ICA Settlement** | Cross-border settlement to merchant's overseas bank account in foreign currency. |

### API Environments

| Environment | Base URL |
|---|---|
| Sandbox | `https://sandbox.cashfree.com/` |
| Production | `https://api.cashfree.com/` |

> Standard PG endpoints use `/pg` prefix. Cross-border-specific endpoints use `/import` prefix.

### Authentication

```
x-client-id: <Your App ID>
x-client-secret: <Your Secret Key>
x-api-version: 2025-01-01
Content-Type: application/json
```

**Never expose `x-client-secret` in frontend/client-side code.**

### API Endpoint Map

| API | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Create Order | `POST /pg/orders` | Create payment order (standard) |
| Get Payment | `GET /pg/orders/{order_id}/payments/{cf_payment_id}` | Verify payment status (standard) |
| Upload Verification Details | `POST /import/transactions/{cf_payment_id}/details` | Upload compliance documents |
| Get Verification Details | `GET /import/transactions/{cf_payment_id}` | Check verification status |
| Get Import Settlement | `GET /import/settlements` | Get ICA settlement details |
| Get Settlement Recon | `GET /import/settlements/recon` | Settlement reconciliation events |

## 3. Workflow A: Complete Cross-Border Payment Flow

### Step 1: Create Order

```json
POST /pg/orders
Headers: x-client-id, x-client-secret, x-api-version: 2025-01-01

{
  "order_id": "order_crossborder_001",
  "order_amount": 1000.00,
  "order_currency": "INR",
  "customer_details": {
    "customer_id": "customer_india_123",
    "customer_email": "customer@example.com",
    "customer_phone": "9999999999"
  },
  "order_meta": {
    "return_url": "https://yoursite.com/return?order_id={order_id}",
    "notify_url": "https://yoursite.com/webhook"
  }
}
```

Response: extract `payment_session_id` and `order_id`, send to your frontend.

**Alternative:** Submit verification details at order creation time via `order_tags` — see `references/REFERENCE.md` Workflow C.

### Step 2: Collect Payment

Use Cashfree Checkout JS, Mobile SDK, or S2S API to collect payment from the Indian customer. Identical to standard PG integration.

```html
<script src="https://sdk.cashfree.com/js/v3/cashfree.js"></script>
<script>
  const cashfree = Cashfree({ mode: "sandbox" }); // or "production"
  cashfree.checkout({
    paymentSessionId: paymentSessionId,
    redirectTarget: "_modal"
  });
</script>
```

### Step 3: Verify Payment Status

```
GET /pg/orders/{order_id}/payments/{cf_payment_id}
Headers: x-client-id, x-client-secret, x-api-version: 2025-01-01
```

### Step 4: Upload Verification Details (Cross-Border Specific)

After a successful payment, upload compliance documents for PA-CB regulatory compliance.

```
POST /import/transactions/{cf_payment_id}/details
Headers: x-client-id, x-client-secret, x-api-version: 2025-01-01
```

```json
{
  "goods_description": "Premium chocolate assortment",
  "invoice_number": "INV-2025-001",
  "importer_name": "John Doe",
  "importer_address": "123 Main Street, Mumbai",
  "importer_address_postal_code": "400001",
  "country_of_origin": "USA",
  "hs_code": "1806",
  "ecommerce_order_serial_number": "ECO-12345",
  "shipment_date": "01/07/2025",
  "port_of_loading": "Los Angeles",
  "awb_number": "AWB123456789"
}
```

```javascript
// Node.js
const uploadVerificationDetails = async (cfPaymentId, details) => {
  const response = await fetch(
    `https://api.cashfree.com/import/transactions/${cfPaymentId}/details`,
    {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'x-client-id': process.env.CASHFREE_CLIENT_ID,
        'x-client-secret': process.env.CASHFREE_CLIENT_SECRET,
        'x-api-version': '2025-01-01',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(details)
    }
  );
  return response.json();
};
```

### Step 5: Monitor Verification Status

```
GET /import/transactions/{cf_payment_id}
Headers: x-client-id, x-client-secret, x-api-version: 2025-01-01
```

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `ACTION_REQUIRED` | Documents missing or need resubmission |
| `IN_REVIEW` | Documents submitted and under Cashfree review |
| `VERIFIED` | All documents verified — settlement proceeds |
| `REJECTED` | Documents rejected — check `remarks` for reason and resubmit |

### Step 6: Receive Settlement

Once verification is complete, Cashfree settles funds to your overseas bank account in foreign currency. Settlements can be as fast as **T+2 days**.

```
GET /import/settlements
Headers: x-client-id, x-client-secret, x-api-version: 2025-01-01
```

## 4. Workflow B: Handle Cross-Border Webhooks

Cross-border has two additional webhook events beyond standard PG webhooks.

**Prerequisites:** Subscribe to `PAYMENT_VERIFICATION_UPDATE` and `ICA_SETTLEMENT_UPDATE` in Dashboard > Developers > Webhooks.

| Event | Description |
|---|---|
| `PAYMENT_VERIFICATION_UPDATE` | Verification status changed (documents reviewed, action required, verified, or rejected) |
| `ICA_SETTLEMENT_UPDATE` | ICA settlement status updated |
| `PAYMENT_SUCCESS_WEBHOOK` | Standard PG — payment completed successfully |
| `PAYMENT_FAILED_WEBHOOK` | Standard PG — payment failed |

```javascript
// Node.js — verify signature + route by event type
const crypto = require('crypto');

app.post('/webhook/cashfree', express.raw({ type: 'application/json' }), (req, res) => {
  const signature = req.headers['x-webhook-signature'];
  const timestamp = req.headers['x-webhook-timestamp'];
  const rawBody = req.body.toString();

  const expectedSignature = crypto
    .createHmac('sha256', process.env.CASHFREE_CLIENT_SECRET)
    .update(timestamp + rawBody)
    .digest('base64');

  if (signature !== expectedSignature) {
    return res.status(401).send('Invalid signature');
  }

  const payload = JSON.parse(rawBody);

  switch (payload.type) {
    case 'PAYMENT_VERIFICATION_UPDATE':
      if (payload.data.payment_verification_status === 'ACTION_REQUIRED') {
        const actionItems = payload.data.required_details.filter(
          d => d.doc_status === 'ACTION_REQUIRED'
        );
        // Upload missing documents for: actionItems.map(d => d.doc_name)
      }
      break;
    case 'ICA_SETTLEMENT_UPDATE':
      // payload.data.cf_ica_settlement_id, payload.data.status
      break;
    case 'PAYMENT_SUCCESS_WEBHOOK':
      // verify then fulfill
      break;
    case 'PAYMENT_FAILED_WEBHOOK':
      break;
  }

  res.status(200).send('OK');
});
```

**Webhook IP whitelist:**

| Environment | IPs |
|---|---|
| Sandbox | `52.66.25.127`, `15.206.45.168` |
| Production | `52.66.101.190`, `3.109.102.144`, `18.60.134.245`, `18.60.183.142` |

Port 443 (HTTPS only). Return HTTP 200 to acknowledge. Implement idempotency to handle duplicate deliveries.

## 5. Decision Rules

- **Have all verification details at order creation time** → Submit via `order_tags` (Workflow C in REFERENCE.md).
- **Don't have details at creation time** → Upload separately after payment via `POST /import/transactions/{cf_payment_id}/details`.
- **`ACTION_REQUIRED` webhook received** → Check `required_details` array, upload missing documents.
- **`REJECTED` status** → Check `remarks` field, fix issues, and resubmit.
- **Selling digital services** → `importer_name`, `goods_description`, `invoice_number`, `importer_address_line`, `importer_address_postal_code`, `country_of_origin`, `invoice_file`.
- **Selling digital goods** → All digital services fields + `hs_code` + `ecommerce_order_serial_number`.
- **Selling physical goods** → All digital goods fields + `shipment_date` + `port_of_loading` + `awb_number`.
- **Web frontend** → Cashfree Checkout JS. **Mobile** → Mobile SDK. **Backend only** → S2S API.

---

## 6. Security — Never Violate

- **Never expose `x-client-secret` in frontend/client-side code.**
- **Always verify webhook signatures** using raw request body + HMAC-SHA256.
- **Complete all verification uploads** — unverified payments will not be settled.
- **Store credentials in environment variables**, never hardcoded.
