## 2. Workflow C: Submit Verification Details via Order Tags (At Order Creation)

Use when you already have all verification details at order creation time. Avoids a separate API call after payment.

Include verification details in the `order_tags` parameter when calling `POST /pg/orders`:

```json
{
  "order_id": "order_crossborder_003",
  "order_amount": 500.00,
  "order_currency": "INR",
  "customer_details": {
    "customer_id": "cust_456",
    "customer_phone": "9999999999"
  },
  "order_tags": {
    "imports_importer_name": "JOHN DOE INDUSTRIES",
    "imports_importer_address_postal_code": "533103",
    "imports_goods_description": "chocolates",
    "imports_invoice_number": "52300"
  }
}
```

After payment:
1. Monitor verification status via `GET /import/transactions/{cf_payment_id}` or `PAYMENT_VERIFICATION_UPDATE` webhook.
2. If additional documents are required (`ACTION_REQUIRED`), upload them via `POST /import/transactions/{cf_payment_id}/details`.

## 3. Workflow D: Submit Verification Details for Subscription Charges

For recurring cross-border payments via Cashfree Subscriptions, pass verification details in `payment_tags`:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.cashfree.com/pg/subscriptions/pay' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'x-api-version: 2025-01-01' \
--header 'x-client-id: <your_client_id>' \
--header 'x-client-secret: <your_client_secret>' \
--data '{
    "subscription_id": "substest",
    "payment_id": "paymenttest",
    "payment_type": "CHARGE",
    "payment_amount": 1,
    "payment_schedule_date": "2025-07-12T10:00:00+05:30",
    "payment_tags": {
        "imports_goods_description": "chocolates",
        "imports_importer_address_postal_code": "560075",
        "imports_importer_name": "John Doe"
    }
}'
```

## 4. Workflow E: Sandbox Testing

### Test Values for Transaction Verification

In sandbox, use these predefined values that are automatically approved:

| Field | Test Value |
|---|---|
| `importer_name` | `John` |
| `importer_address` | `321 Elm Street, Suite 3, Los Angeles, CA 90401, USA` |
| `goods_description` | `This is a test product for test purpose` |
| `country_of_origin` | `USA` |
| `ecommerce_order_serial_number` | `123123` |
| `invoice_number` | `234234` |
| `hs_code` | `3456` |
| `shipment_date` | `01/01/2027` |
| `port_of_loading` | `Houston` |
| `importer_address_postal_code` | `560034` |

For file-type content (e.g., `invoice_file`), the sandbox approves **PDF files** and rejects other formats.

### Simulate Settlement

**Trigger settlement:**
```
POST /import/settlements/simulate
Headers: x-client-id, x-client-secret, x-api-version: 2025-01-01
```

This is asynchronous — settlement entries typically created within one second.

**Mark settlement as processed:**
```
POST /import/settlements/simulate/processed
Headers: x-client-id, x-client-secret, x-api-version: 2025-01-01
```

> The sandbox forex rate is notional and may differ from actual foreign exchange rates.

**Simulate a skipped settlement:**
1. Create a transaction.
2. Refund the transaction.
3. Trigger settlement using the API.
4. Settlement will be skipped (total collection amount < 0).
