## 1. Overview

Cashfree Secure ID is a comprehensive identity verification and fraud prevention suite. RESTful APIs for real-time identity verification, document authentication, biometric checks, and digital onboarding — all with sub-second response times.

**This is primarily a backend integration** — API calls should be routed through your server. Frontend SDKs are available for DigiLocker (React Native), Video KYC (Web, Android, iOS), and 1-Click Onboarding (Web, Android, iOS).

**Product Categories:**
1. **Core Banking Services**: Bank Account Verification — a.k.a. "penny drop", Cashfree credits ₹1 *into* the account (Sync/Async/Bulk), IFSC, Reverse Penny Drop (opposite direction — holder pays ₹1 *from* the account; for self-verification, not beneficiary validation), UPI Penny Drop, Mobile Penny Drop
2. **Identity Verification**: PAN (Verify/Lite/360/Bulk), Aadhaar (via DigiLocker), Driving Licence, Passport, Voter ID
3. **Business Verification (KYB)**: GSTIN, CIN, Udyam, PAN to GSTIN, PAN to Udyam

## 2. Environment Configuration

| Environment | Base URL |
|---|---|
| Production | `https://api.cashfree.com/verification` |
| Sandbox | `https://sandbox.cashfree.com/verification` |

### Required Headers

```
X-Client-Id: <YOUR_CLIENT_ID>
X-Client-Secret: <YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>
x-api-version: 2024-12-01
Content-Type: application/json
```

> **`x-api-version: 2024-12-01` is required on every current (v2) Secure ID call.** A few legacy PAN-era endpoints also accept `2022-10-26`. Send it on every request — the examples below include it.

### Optional Headers

```
X-Cf-Signature: <RSA_ENCRYPTED_SIGNATURE>  (required if 2FA with public key is enabled)
```

---

## 3. Authentication

### Direct Authentication

Use `X-Client-Id` and `X-Client-Secret` headers directly with every API request.

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://sandbox.cashfree.com/verification/pan' \
  -H 'X-Client-Id: <CLIENT_ID>' \
  -H 'X-Client-Secret: <CLIENT_SECRET>' \
  -H 'x-api-version: 2024-12-01' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{ "pan": "ABCPV1234D" }'
```

### Generate API Keys

1. Log in to your **Secure ID Dashboard** → click **Developers**
2. Click **API Keys** → **Generate API Keys**
3. Download and securely store the keys

- Maximum of **10 API keys** can be generated
- Production keys require **OTP authentication**
- **Never share keys** — they are confidential

---

## 4. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

### Option 1: IP Whitelisting

1. **Secure ID Dashboard** → **Developers** → **Two-Factor Authentication**
2. Choose **IP Whitelist** from the dropdown
3. Click **Add IP Address** and enter your IPv4 address

- Only **IPv4** is supported (not IPv6)
- Whitelist up to **25 IP addresses**
- Only the **production** environment requires IP whitelisting

### Option 2: Public Key Signature (Dynamic IP)

Encrypt `clientId.timestamp` using RSA with the public key downloaded from Dashboard. Pass in `X-Cf-Signature` header. Signature is valid for **5 minutes**.

**PHP:**
```php
public static function getSignature() {
    $clientId = "<your clientId here>";
    $publicKey = openssl_pkey_get_public(file_get_contents("/path/to/public_key.pem"));
    $encodedData = $clientId . "." . strtotime("now");
    openssl_public_encrypt($encodedData, $encrypted, $publicKey, OPENSSL_PKCS1_OAEP_PADDING);
    return base64_encode($encrypted);
}
```

> For Java RSA signature code — see `references/REFERENCE.md`.

## 5. Core API Examples

### Bank Account Verification — "Penny Drop"

> **"Penny drop" = Bank Account Verification (BAV).** Cashfree deposits ₹1 **into** the account to confirm it is valid and active and returns the name registered at the bank. This is what is meant by "penny drop", "verify a bank account", or "validate a beneficiary before payout". **Use the `/bank-account/*` endpoints below.**
>
> ⚠️ **Do NOT use Reverse Penny Drop (`/reverse-penny-drop`) for this.** RPD is the *opposite* direction — the account **holder** sends ₹1 **from** their own account via a UPI intent/QR/collect link (auto-refunded). It is for *user self-verification during onboarding*, not for validating a beneficiary you are about to pay. Different endpoint, different payload, different purpose. If the requirement is "verify/validate this bank account", always use BAV — never `reverse-penny-drop`. See `references/REFERENCE.md` § Reverse Penny Drop.

**Sync — `POST /bank-account/sync`** — real-time; the verification result (`account_status`, `name_at_bank`, name-match score) is returned **in the HTTP response**. Use this for a single interactive check. Default choice for "verify a bank account".

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://sandbox.cashfree.com/verification/bank-account/sync' \
  -H 'X-Client-Id: <CLIENT_ID>' \
  -H 'X-Client-Secret: <CLIENT_SECRET>' \
  -H 'x-api-version: 2024-12-01' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "bank_account": "026291800001191",
    "ifsc": "YESB0000262",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "phone": "9999999999"
  }'
```

**Async — `POST /bank-account/async`** (use for bulk / high volume) — the POST returns only an **acknowledgement** with a `reference_id`, **not** the verification outcome. The final result arrives via webhook (`BANK_ACCOUNT_VERIFICATION_SUCCESS` / `_REJECTED` / `_FAILED`) or by polling `GET /bank-account?reference_id=...`.

> ⚠️ **Async result trap:** never treat the async submission response as the final verification result — it only confirms the request was accepted. You **must** implement a webhook handler (or poll the status endpoint) to capture the actual `account_status`. The sync endpoint above does return the result inline; the async/bulk and RPD flows do not.

> Cashfree does not support verification of Deutsche Bank and Paytm Payments Bank accounts. IMPS verifies only the first 5 characters of the IFSC code.

### PAN Verification

**Endpoint:** `POST /pan`

Check PAN existence. Returns registered name and PAN type.

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://sandbox.cashfree.com/verification/pan' \
  -H 'X-Client-Id: <CLIENT_ID>' \
  -H 'X-Client-Secret: <CLIENT_SECRET>' \
  -H 'x-api-version: 2024-12-01' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "pan": "ABCPV1234D",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "verification_id": "PAN_001"
  }'
```

> The name returned may differ from the physical PAN card — it returns the registered name from the Income Tax Department's records.

### GSTIN Verification

**Endpoint:** `POST /gstin`

Verify GSTIN and retrieve business registration details.

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://sandbox.cashfree.com/verification/gstin' \
  -H 'X-Client-Id: <CLIENT_ID>' \
  -H 'X-Client-Secret: <CLIENT_SECRET>' \
  -H 'x-api-version: 2024-12-01' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "GSTIN": "29AAICP2912R1ZR",
    "business_name": "Business Name",
    "verification_id": "GSTIN_001"
  }'
```

## 6. DigiLocker Integration Flow

1. **Verify Account** (`POST /digilocker/verify-account`) — Check if Aadhaar/mobile is linked with DigiLocker
2. **Create URL** (`POST /digilocker`) — Generate time-sensitive consent URL (valid **10 minutes**)
3. **Redirect** — User logs in with Aadhaar/mobile, enters OTP, approves consent
4. **Get Document** (`GET /digilocker/document/{document_type}`) — Fetch a verified document (Aadhaar, PAN, DL)
5. **Status** — delivered via the `DIGILOCKER_VERIFICATION_*` webhook (there is no `GET /digilocker/status` endpoint)

> DigiLocker flow in Sandbox requires **real Aadhaar numbers** — mock details are not supported.

---

### Webhook Signature Verification

```javascript
// Node.js — HMAC-SHA256 signature verification
const crypto = require('crypto');

function verifySecureIdWebhook(req) {
  const rawBody = req.body.toString();
  const timestamp = req.headers['x-webhook-timestamp'];
  const signature = req.headers['x-webhook-signature'];

  const computed = crypto
    .createHmac('sha256', process.env.CASHFREE_CLIENT_SECRET)
    .update(timestamp + rawBody)
    .digest('base64');

  return computed === signature;
}
```

## 8. Security — Never Violate

- **Never call Secure ID APIs from frontend code.** Route through your backend only.
- **Never expose `X-Client-Secret`** in client-side code or version control.
- **Always verify webhook signatures** before processing.
- **Store credentials in environment variables**, never hardcoded.
