# Cashfree Payment Gateway – Server-to-Server (S2S) REST API Integration

> **References available:** This SKILL.md covers the core integration flow. For payment method objects (Card, UPI, Netbanking, Wallet, EMI, Paylater), advanced workflows (Native OTP, UPI Collect, Refunds, Pre-Authorization), rate limits, and error codes — read `references/REFERENCE.md` in this directory.

## 1. Scope & Boundaries

### When to use this skill

- The developer wants to integrate Cashfree Payment Gateway using **direct HTTP/REST API calls** from their backend — no Cashfree frontend SDK, no Cashfree Checkout JS, no Drop-in UI.
- The developer is working in a language without an official Cashfree SDK (Ruby, Rust, Elixir, etc.), or explicitly prefers raw HTTP calls (cURL, Postman, `fetch`, `axios`, `http.client`, etc.).
- The integration is **server-to-server (S2S)**: the merchant's backend orchestrates the entire payment lifecycle.

### When NOT to use this skill

- If the developer wants to use **Cashfree Checkout JS**, **Drop-in**, or **Components** — use the Checkout integration skill instead.
- If the developer is using an **official Cashfree SDK** (Node.js, Python, Java, Go, PHP, .NET) — use the Backend SDK skill instead.
- If the question is about **Payouts**, **Subscriptions/Recurring**, **Token Vault standalone**, **Verification Suite**, or **Secure ID** — those are separate products.

## 2. Structural Overview

### Core Objects

| Object | Description |
|---|---|
| **Order** | Top-level entity. Has `order_id`, `order_amount`, `order_currency`, `customer_details`. Created via `POST /orders`. Returns `payment_session_id`. |
| **Payment Session** | Short-lived token (`payment_session_id`) required to initiate payment via the Order Pay API. |
| **Payment** | A payment attempt against an order. Identified by `cf_payment_id`. An order can have multiple attempts. |
| **Refund** | A reversal of a successful payment. Identified by `refund_id`. |
| **Webhook** | Asynchronous server-to-server notification from Cashfree when a payment event occurs. |

### API Environments

| Environment | Base URL |
|---|---|
| Sandbox | `https://sandbox.cashfree.com/pg` |
| Production | `https://api.cashfree.com/pg` |

### Authentication

Every API call (except Order Pay) requires these headers:

```
x-client-id: <Your App ID>
x-client-secret: <Your Secret Key>
x-api-version: 2025-01-01
Content-Type: application/json
```

Credentials from [Merchant Dashboard](https://merchant.cashfree.com/auth/login/pg/developers/api-keys?env=prod). The **Order Pay API** (`POST /orders/sessions`) does NOT require `x-client-id`/`x-client-secret` — it authenticates via `payment_session_id`.

### Primary API Endpoints

| Step | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Create Order | `POST /orders` | Create a payment order, get `payment_session_id` |
| Pay Order | `POST /orders/sessions` | Submit payment details for a specific method |
| Authenticate (OTP) | `POST /orders/pay/authenticate/{cf_payment_id}` | Submit or resend OTP (Native OTP flow) |
| Get Order | `GET /orders/{order_id}` | Check order status |
| Get Payments | `GET /orders/{order_id}/payments` | List all payment attempts for an order |
| Get Payment by ID | `GET /orders/{order_id}/payments/{cf_payment_id}` | Get a specific payment attempt |
| Create Refund | `POST /orders/{order_id}/refunds` | Initiate a refund |
| Get Refund | `GET /orders/{order_id}/refunds/{refund_id}` | Check refund status |
| Authorize/Capture | `POST /orders/{order_id}/authorization` | Capture or void a pre-authorized payment |

> For rate limits per endpoint, see `references/REFERENCE.md` Section 1.

## 3. Core Workflow: Create Order → Pay → Verify

This is the standard integration flow for most payment methods (Card, Netbanking, Wallet, EMI, Paylater).

**Prerequisites:**
- S2S flag enabled on your Cashfree account.
- API credentials from Merchant Dashboard.
- A webhook endpoint configured in Dashboard > Developers > Webhooks.
- Domain whitelisted in Merchant Dashboard.

### Step 1: Create Order

```
POST /orders
Headers: x-client-id, x-client-secret, x-api-version: 2025-01-01, Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{
    "order_id": "unique_order_id",
    "order_amount": 100.00,
    "order_currency": "INR",
    "customer_details": {
        "customer_id": "customer_123",
        "customer_phone": "9999999999",
        "customer_email": "customer@example.com",
        "customer_name": "John Doe"
    },
    "order_meta": {
        "return_url": "https://yoursite.com/return",
        "notify_url": "https://yoursite.com/webhook",
        "payment_methods": "cc,dc,upi,nb"
    },
    "order_expiry_time": "2025-07-02T10:20:12+05:30",
    "order_note": "Optional order note"
}
```

**Required:** `order_amount`, `order_currency`, `customer_details.customer_id`, `customer_details.customer_phone`

**On `return_url`:** Cashfree appends `?order_id=ORDER_ID` to whatever URL you supply — keep it a static path (`https://yoursite.com/return`) and read `order_id` from the query string on your handler. If you need Cashfree's server-side `{order_id}` substitution token, leave it as a literal string (`"https://yoursite.com/return/{order_id}"`) — **but** if you're building the URL inside a Python f-string, escape it as `{{order_id}}`, or (better) skip the token entirely. Localhost URLs and route placeholders that Flask/Express try to match against the literal string `{order_id}` are a common production-breaking bug.

**Response — extract and store `payment_session_id`:**

```json
{
    "cf_order_id": "2149460581",
    "order_id": "order_123",
    "order_status": "ACTIVE",
    "payment_session_id": "session_xxx..."
}
```

### Step 2: Call Order Pay API

```
POST /orders/sessions
Headers: x-api-version: 2025-01-01, Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{
    "payment_session_id": "<from Step 1>",
    "payment_method": {
        "<method_key>": { }
    }
}
```

> For the `payment_method` object structure for Card, UPI, Netbanking, Wallet, EMI, Paylater, and Bank Transfer — see `references/REFERENCE.md` Section 2.

**Response — `PayOrderEntity`:**

```json
{
    "action": "link | post | custom | form",
    "cf_payment_id": "string",
    "data": {
        "url": "redirect URL or OTP/form submission URL",
        "payload": { },
        "content_type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
        "method": "POST",
        "redirect_to_bank": "fallback bank redirect URL (Native OTP only)"
    }
}
```

**Decision rules for `action`:**

- **`"link"`** → Redirect the customer to `data.url`.
- **`"post"`** → Native OTP flow. Render OTP input UI, POST OTP to `data.url`. See `REFERENCE.md` Workflow B.
- **`"form"`** → `data.payload` is an **object of key/value pairs**. Build a form with those as fields and submit (using `data.method` / `data.content_type`) to `data.url`.
- **`"custom"`** → Poll `GET /orders/{order_id}/payments` every 3–5 seconds (UPI collect, bank transfer).

### Step 3: Verify Payment (MANDATORY)

**Always verify from your backend before fulfilling orders. Never rely solely on frontend callbacks.**

```
GET /orders/{order_id}
Headers: x-client-id, x-client-secret, x-api-version: 2025-01-01
```

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `PAID` | Payment completed — safe to fulfill |
| `ACTIVE` | Still awaiting payment |
| `EXPIRED` | Expired with no successful payment |

For payment-level status: `GET /orders/{order_id}/payments/{cf_payment_id}`

Payment status values: `SUCCESS`, `FAILED`, `PENDING`, `NOT_ATTEMPTED`, `USER_DROPPED`, `VOID`, `CANCELLED`

### Step 4: Process Webhooks

Cashfree sends async notifications to your `notify_url`.

**Webhook events:** `PAYMENT_SUCCESS_WEBHOOK`, `PAYMENT_FAILED_WEBHOOK`, `PAYMENT_USER_DROPPED_WEBHOOK`, `REFUND_STATUS_WEBHOOK`, and the settlement events `SETTLEMENT_INITIATED`, `SETTLEMENT_SUCCESS`, `SETTLEMENT_FAILED`, `SETTLEMENT_REVERSED`

**Signature verification (REQUIRED — never skip):**

1. Extract `x-webhook-timestamp` from headers.
2. Concatenate: `timestamp + rawBody` (raw body, NOT parsed JSON).
3. Generate HMAC-SHA256 using your `x-client-secret`.
4. Base64-encode. Compare with `x-webhook-signature` header.

```javascript
// Node.js
const crypto = require("crypto");
function verifyWebhookSignature(timestamp, rawBody, signature, secretKey) {
    const computed = crypto.createHmac("sha256", secretKey).update(timestamp + rawBody).digest("base64");
    return computed === signature;
}
```

```python
# Python
import base64, hashlib, hmac
def verify_webhook_signature(timestamp, raw_body, signature, secret_key):
    message = (timestamp + raw_body).encode('utf-8')
    computed = base64.b64encode(hmac.new(secret_key.encode('utf-8'), message, digestmod=hashlib.sha256).digest()).decode('utf-8')
    return computed == signature
```

```go
// Go
func VerifySignature(signature, timestamp, rawBody, secretKey string) bool {
    h := hmac.New(sha256.New, []byte(secretKey))
    h.Write([]byte(timestamp + rawBody))
    return base64.StdEncoding.EncodeToString(h.Sum(nil)) == signature
}
```

**Requirements:** Return HTTP 200. Implement idempotency. Process async for long-running work.

---

## 4. Security Constraints — Never Violate

- **Never expose `x-client-secret` in frontend/client-side code.**
- **Never fulfill an order based solely on frontend callbacks or return_url parameters.** Always verify via `GET /orders/{order_id}`.
- **Never process a webhook without verifying its signature.**
- **Always use the raw request body for webhook verification**, not parsed JSON.
