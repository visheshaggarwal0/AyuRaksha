# Cashfree Disputes — Reference

> Read `../SKILL.md` first for the dispute lifecycle and the decide-to-accept-or-contest workflow. This file is the schema + code + status-enum source of truth.

## 1. Endpoint Map

| Method | Path | Purpose | SDK method |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET  | `/pg/disputes/{dispute_id}` | Fetch one dispute with full evidence context | `PGFetchDisputeByID` |
| GET  | `/pg/orders/{order_id}/disputes` | List disputes on an order | `PGFetchOrderDisputes` |
| GET  | `/pg/payments/{cf_payment_id}/disputes` | List disputes on a specific payment attempt | `PGFetchPaymentDisputes` |
| PUT  | `/pg/disputes/{dispute_id}/accept` | Accept liability (terminal) | `PGAcceptDisputeByID` |
| POST | `/pg/disputes/{dispute_id}/documents` | Contest = upload evidence (`multipart/form-data`) | `PGUploadDisputesDocuments` |

> The methods `PGFetchDispute` / `PGContestDispute` do **not** exist — use the names above.

All endpoints require `x-client-id`, `x-client-secret`, `x-api-version: 2025-01-01`, `Content-Type: application/json`. Partner / signature auth variants also supported (`x-partner-apikey`, `x-client-signature`) — see `pg/apis/references/REFERENCE.md`.

### Rate limits (production)

~30/min per endpoint, per account. Sandbox is lower. Back off on `429` per `x-ratelimit-retry`.

## 3. `dispute_type` Enum

| Value | Meaning | Typical network | Typical SLA |
|---|---|---|---|
| `RETRIEVAL` | Issuer asking for info; no debit yet | Visa / MC | 7 days |
| `DISPUTE` | UPI / NPCI-style in-app dispute; pre-chargeback | UPI | 7–15 days |
| `CHARGEBACK` | Formal reversal; amount already debited | All | 30 days (card) / 7 days (UPI) |
| `PRE_ARBITRATION` | Issuer rejected merchant's chargeback win | Visa / MC | 30 days |
| `ARBITRATION` | Network adjudicates; loser pays arb fee | Visa / MC | 30–45 days |

---

## 4. `dispute_status` — All 35 Values

Pattern: `{TYPE}_{SUB_STATUS}`. All **5 types × 7 sub-statuses = 35** values exist (every pair is valid):

### Sub-statuses

| Sub-status | Meaning | Terminal? |
|---|---|---|
| `CREATED` | New — merchant action needed | No |
| `DOCS_RECEIVED` | Cashfree/bank received contest evidence | No |
| `UNDER_REVIEW` | Bank/network evaluating | No |
| `MERCHANT_WON` | Evidence accepted; funds return | **Yes** |
| `MERCHANT_LOST` | Evidence rejected; funds stay debited | **Yes** |
| `MERCHANT_ACCEPTED` | Merchant chose to accept | **Yes** |
| `INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE` | Merchant did not respond in time / evidence rejected outright | **Yes** (auto-loss) |

### Valid combinations you'll see

```
RETRIEVAL_CREATED, RETRIEVAL_DOCS_RECEIVED, RETRIEVAL_UNDER_REVIEW,
RETRIEVAL_MERCHANT_WON, RETRIEVAL_MERCHANT_LOST, RETRIEVAL_MERCHANT_ACCEPTED,
RETRIEVAL_INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE,

DISPUTE_CREATED, DISPUTE_DOCS_RECEIVED, DISPUTE_UNDER_REVIEW,
DISPUTE_MERCHANT_WON, DISPUTE_MERCHANT_LOST, DISPUTE_MERCHANT_ACCEPTED,
DISPUTE_INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE,

CHARGEBACK_CREATED, CHARGEBACK_DOCS_RECEIVED, CHARGEBACK_UNDER_REVIEW,
CHARGEBACK_MERCHANT_WON, CHARGEBACK_MERCHANT_LOST, CHARGEBACK_MERCHANT_ACCEPTED,
CHARGEBACK_INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE,

PRE_ARBITRATION_CREATED, PRE_ARBITRATION_DOCS_RECEIVED, PRE_ARBITRATION_UNDER_REVIEW,
PRE_ARBITRATION_MERCHANT_WON, PRE_ARBITRATION_MERCHANT_LOST,
PRE_ARBITRATION_MERCHANT_ACCEPTED, PRE_ARBITRATION_INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE,

ARBITRATION_CREATED, ARBITRATION_DOCS_RECEIVED, ARBITRATION_UNDER_REVIEW,
ARBITRATION_MERCHANT_WON, ARBITRATION_MERCHANT_LOST,
ARBITRATION_MERCHANT_ACCEPTED, ARBITRATION_INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE
```

---

## 5. Reason-Code Reference (common)

Reason codes come from the underlying card network or UPI ruleset. `reason_description` is the human-readable label. Common ones you'll see:

| `reason_code` | `reason_description` | What the bank wants |
|---|---|---|
| `1401` | Fraud Transaction — Card Not Present | KYC of cardholder, 3DS logs, IP/device info, AVS match |
| `4855` | Goods or Services Not Received | Tracking, proof of delivery, signature |
| `4853` | Cardholder Disputes — Quality | Product description vs. delivered, customer communication |
| `4834` | Duplicate Processing | Evidence that each charge was for distinct goods/services |
| `4863` | Cardholder Does Not Recognize | Invoice, customer communication, AVS/3DS trace |
| `RR-001` (UPI) | Customer Claim – Unauthorized Debit | KYC, device logs, order context |
| `RR-005` (UPI) | Credit Not Processed | Refund ARN + bank proof |

Networks change reason-code semantics periodically. Always let `preferred_evidence` drive your evidence UI rather than maintaining a static table.

---

## 6. Accept & Contest

### Accept — `PUT /pg/disputes/{dispute_id}/accept`

No body required. Response is the current dispute object with `dispute_status: "{TYPE}_MERCHANT_ACCEPTED"`. SDK: `PGAcceptDisputeByID`.

### Contest — `POST /pg/disputes/{dispute_id}/documents`

There is **no JSON "contest" call**. You contest by **uploading evidence documents** as `multipart/form-data`, one document per request. SDK: `PGUploadDisputesDocuments`.

| Form field | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `file` | Yes | The document (PDF/JPG/PNG). **Max 20 MB.** |
| `doc_type` | Yes | Evidence category — match a `document_type` from the dispute's `preferred_evidence` |
| `note` | No | Free-text note for the bank |

### Evidence document limits

| Limit | Value |
|---|---|
| Max file size per document | **20 MB** |
| Supported formats | PDF, JPG, JPEG, PNG |
| Submission | Direct file upload (`multipart/form-data`) — Cashfree does **not** fetch from a URL |

### When you can contest

Only while `dispute_status` ends in `CREATED` or `DOCS_RECEIVED`. Once `UNDER_REVIEW` or terminal, an upload returns `409`. If the bank reopens (rare), a `DISPUTE_UPDATED` webhook reverts to `DOCS_RECEIVED` and you may re-submit.

### Best practice: upload one document per `preferred_evidence` item

```javascript
const dispute = await cashfree.PGFetchDisputeByID(disputeId);
// preferred_evidence items carry { document_type, document_description }
for (const ev of dispute.data.preferred_evidence) {
    const filePath = await gatherDocumentFor(ev.document_type);   // your code
    await cashfree.PGUploadDisputesDocuments(
        disputeId,
        fs.createReadStream(filePath),       // file
        ev.document_type,                    // doc_type
        `Evidence for ${ev.document_type}`,  // note
    );
}
```

## 7. Webhook Events — Full Payloads

### Signature

Identical to all other Cashfree webhooks: `Base64(HMAC-SHA256(x-webhook-timestamp + rawBody, CASHFREE_SECRET_KEY))` = `x-webhook-signature`. `x-idempotency-key` header is present on v2025-01-01+.

### `DISPUTE_CREATED`

See SKILL.md §3 Step 1 for a full sample. Key points:

- Fires at every initial dispute — including each re-escalation (pre-arb, arb) as its own `DISPUTE_CREATED`.
- `data.dispute.respond_by` is the SLA.
- `data.dispute.dispute_action_on: "MERCHANT"` — action is yours.

### `DISPUTE_UPDATED`

Same envelope; fires on any of:

- Status change within a dispute (e.g., `CHARGEBACK_CREATED` → `CHARGEBACK_DOCS_RECEIVED`).
- Bank adding `cf_dispute_remarks` / issuer comments.
- `respond_by` extension (rare; occasionally Cashfree extends by one business day).
- Additional evidence request.

```json
{
    "data": {
        "dispute": {
            "dispute_id": "1234567",
            "dispute_type": "CHARGEBACK",
            "dispute_status": "CHARGEBACK_UNDER_REVIEW",
            "dispute_update": "Evidence received; under bank review.",
            "updated_at": "2026-04-19T14:00:00+05:30",
            "respond_by": "2026-05-18T23:59:59+05:30",
            ...
        },
        "order_details":     { ... },
        "customer_details":  { ... }
    },
    "event_time": "2026-04-19T14:00:00+05:30",
    "type": "DISPUTE_UPDATED"
}
```

### `DISPUTE_CLOSED`

Terminal. `resolved_at` is populated; `dispute_status` is one of the `MERCHANT_WON` / `MERCHANT_LOST` / `MERCHANT_ACCEPTED` / `INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE` variants.

```json
{
    "data": {
        "dispute": {
            "dispute_id": "1234567",
            "dispute_type": "CHARGEBACK",
            "dispute_status": "CHARGEBACK_MERCHANT_WON",
            "resolved_at": "2026-05-10T12:00:00+05:30",
            ...
        },
        "order_details":    { ... },
        "customer_details": { ... }
    },
    "event_time": "2026-05-10T12:00:00+05:30",
    "type": "DISPUTE_CLOSED"
}
```

Note: resolution may result in escalation — a `MERCHANT_WON` at `CHARGEBACK` can be followed days later by a fresh `DISPUTE_CREATED` at `PRE_ARBITRATION`.

## 8. Per-Language SDK Usage

Use the SDK methods (`PGFetchDisputeByID`, `PGAcceptDisputeByID`, `PGUploadDisputesDocuments`) or raw REST. Accept is a **PUT**; contesting = uploading each document as `multipart/form-data` to `/documents`. (Other languages follow the same pattern.)

### Node.js (raw REST)

```javascript
const H = {
    "x-client-id": process.env.CASHFREE_APP_ID,
    "x-client-secret": process.env.CASHFREE_SECRET_KEY,
    "x-api-version": "2025-01-01",
};

// Fetch
const dispute = await fetch(`https://api.cashfree.com/pg/disputes/${disputeId}`, { headers: H }).then(r => r.json());

// Accept (PUT)
await fetch(`https://api.cashfree.com/pg/disputes/${disputeId}/accept`, { method: "PUT", headers: H });

// Contest = upload a document (multipart/form-data)
const form = new FormData();
form.append("file", fs.createReadStream("delivery_proof.pdf"));
form.append("doc_type", "DeliveryProof");
form.append("note", "Delivered 2026-04-01, AWB123456");
await fetch(`https://api.cashfree.com/pg/disputes/${disputeId}/documents`, { method: "POST", headers: H, body: form });
```

### Python (raw REST)

```python
import os, requests
H = {
    "x-client-id": os.environ["CASHFREE_APP_ID"],
    "x-client-secret": os.environ["CASHFREE_SECRET_KEY"],
    "x-api-version": "2025-01-01",
}
BASE = "https://api.cashfree.com/pg"

def fetch_dispute(did):
    return requests.get(f"{BASE}/disputes/{did}", headers=H, timeout=10).json()

def accept_dispute(did):
    return requests.put(f"{BASE}/disputes/{did}/accept", headers=H, timeout=10).json()

def upload_evidence(did, file_path, doc_type, note=""):
    with open(file_path, "rb") as f:
        return requests.post(
            f"{BASE}/disputes/{did}/documents", headers=H,
            files={"file": f}, data={"doc_type": doc_type, "note": note}, timeout=30,
        ).json()
```

### cURL

```bash
# Fetch
curl "https://api.cashfree.com/pg/disputes/1234567" \
    -H "x-client-id: $CASHFREE_APP_ID" -H "x-client-secret: $CASHFREE_SECRET_KEY" -H "x-api-version: 2025-01-01"

# Accept (PUT)
curl -X PUT "https://api.cashfree.com/pg/disputes/1234567/accept" \
    -H "x-client-id: $CASHFREE_APP_ID" -H "x-client-secret: $CASHFREE_SECRET_KEY" -H "x-api-version: 2025-01-01"

# Contest = upload each evidence document
curl -X POST "https://api.cashfree.com/pg/disputes/1234567/documents" \
    -H "x-client-id: $CASHFREE_APP_ID" -H "x-client-secret: $CASHFREE_SECRET_KEY" -H "x-api-version: 2025-01-01" \
    -F "file=@delivery_proof.pdf" -F "doc_type=DeliveryProof" -F "note=Delivered 2026-04-01"
```

## 9. Dispute Fees

Cashfree typically passes through the card-network chargeback / retrieval fees to the merchant:

| Event | Fee appearance | Reversible on win? |
|---|---|---|
| Retrieval request | Usually zero or small | N/A |
| Chargeback raised | Per-incident fee (merchant-specific; ₹250–₹500 typical) | Sometimes — network-dependent |
| Arbitration initiated | ₹2000–₹5000 + network fees | Loser pays |

All fees surface in settlement recon as `OTHER_ADJUSTMENT` DEBIT events tied to the `dispute_id`.

---

## 10. How Disputes Affect Refunds

- If you **refund** during an open `RETRIEVAL` or `DISPUTE` stage, the dispute usually auto-closes as resolved. Include the refund `refund_arn` in any follow-up contest evidence.
- If you **refund** during an open `CHARGEBACK`, the amount is **still debited** by the bank — you'll end up with a double-debit that reverses when you accept the chargeback. Avoid refunding once `CHARGEBACK_CREATED` has fired unless you've already accepted.
- If you **win** a chargeback, a `CHARGEBACK_REVERSAL` credits your next settlement. Do not refund in addition — you've already gotten the money back.

---

## 11. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Contest returns `409 dispute_already_closed` | Status moved to UNDER_REVIEW or terminal | Fetch first, check status, contest only on `CREATED`/`DOCS_RECEIVED` |
| Evidence upload returns `400` | File > 20 MB or unsupported format | Keep each file ≤ 20 MB; use PDF/JPG/PNG; upload one doc per `preferred_evidence` item |
| Lost despite contesting | Didn't upload a document for every `preferred_evidence` item | Cover each `preferred_evidence.document_type`; one upload per item |
| Cross-dispute escalation lost by default | Treated `PRE_ARBITRATION_CREATED` as a duplicate of the won chargeback | Treat every `*_CREATED` webhook as a fresh case; new SLA applies |
| `DISPUTE_CLOSED` came without `DISPUTE_UPDATED` | Auto-accept via inaction (`INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE`) | You missed the SLA; wire a reminder |
| `respond_by` is in the past on `DISPUTE_CREATED` | Backdated dispute from a retry | Contest immediately — Cashfree usually accepts late submissions within hours of `respond_by` if the delay is its own |
