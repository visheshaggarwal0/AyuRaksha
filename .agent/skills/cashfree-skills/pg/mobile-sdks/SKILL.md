# Cashfree Payment Gateway – Mobile App SDK Integration

> **References available:** This SKILL.md covers the integration architecture and Android as the canonical example. For iOS, Flutter, React Native, and Cordova full platform code, UPI Intent checkout per platform, and troubleshooting — read `references/REFERENCE.md` in this directory.

## 1. Scope & Boundaries

### When to use this skill

- Integrating Cashfree Payment Gateway into a **mobile application** — Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, or Cordova/Capacitor.
- Needs guidance on SDK installation, session creation, checkout invocation, or callback handling.
- Backend creates orders; the mobile app uses `payment_session_id` to drive checkout.

### When NOT to use this skill

- Web-only integration → use Web Checkout JS or S2S REST API skill.
- Server-to-server payment without any SDK UI → use the S2S REST API skill.
- Backend SDK usage only (Node.js, Python, Java, Go) → use the Backend SDK skill.
- Payouts, Subscriptions, Token Vault standalone, Secure ID → separate skills.

## 2. Integration Architecture

All Cashfree mobile SDK integrations follow a **3-step flow**:

```
1. Create Order (your backend server)
       ↓
2. Open Checkout (mobile SDK on device)
       ↓
3. Confirm Payment (your backend server + webhooks)
```

- **Step 1**: Always server-side. Backend calls `POST /orders`, receives `payment_session_id`.
- **Step 2**: Always client-side. Mobile SDK uses `payment_session_id` to open checkout.
- **Step 3**: Always server-side. Backend verifies via `GET /orders/{order_id}` + webhooks.

### Core Objects

| Object | Description |
|---|---|
| **Order** | Created server-side via `POST /orders`. Returns `payment_session_id`. |
| **CFSession** | SDK session object. Wraps `payment_session_id`, `order_id`, environment. Built per platform. |
| **CFWebCheckoutPayment** | SDK checkout object for full payment page (all methods). |
| **CFUPIIntentCheckoutPayment** | SDK checkout object for native UPI app selection. |
| **onVerify callback** | Payment likely succeeded — must verify from backend. |
| **onError callback** | Payment failed or errored. |

### Supported Platforms

| Platform | Package | Latest SDK |
|---|---|---|
| **Android** | `com.cashfree.pg:api` (Maven) | `2.4.0` (Android SDK 19+) |
| **iOS** | `CashfreePG` (SPM / CocoaPods) | `2.4.0` (iOS 11+) |
| **Flutter** | `flutter_cashfree_pg_sdk` (pub.dev) | `2.4.0+52` |
| **React Native** | `react-native-cashfree-pg-sdk` (npm) | `2.4.0` |
| **Cordova** | `cordova-plugin-cashfree-pg` (npm) | `1.1.0` |

### Checkout Flow Types

| Flow | Description | Use Case |
|---|---|---|
| **Web Checkout** | WebView-based page with all payment methods (cards, UPI, NB, wallets, EMI, paylater) | Default choice |
| **UPI Intent** | Native screen showing installed UPI apps | Native UPI-only experience |

## 3. Core Workflow: Web Checkout

### Step 1: Create Order (Backend)

```
POST /orders
Headers: x-client-id, x-client-secret, x-api-version: 2025-01-01
```

```json
{
  "order_amount": 100.00,
  "order_currency": "INR",
  "customer_details": {
    "customer_id": "customer_123",
    "customer_phone": "9999999999"
  },
  "order_meta": {
    "return_url": "https://yoursite.com/return?order_id=order_123"
  }
}
```

Response: extract `payment_session_id` and `order_id`, send to your mobile app.

### Step 2: Open Checkout (Android — Kotlin)

```kotlin
// Install: implementation 'com.cashfree.pg:api:2.4.0' in build.gradle

// Set callback in onCreate (BEFORE doPayment)
CFPaymentGatewayService.getInstance().setCheckoutCallback(this)

// Create session + initiate checkout
val cfSession = CFSessionBuilder()
    .setEnvironment(CFSession.Environment.SANDBOX) // or .PRODUCTION
    .setPaymentSessionID(paymentSessionId)
    .setOrderId(orderId)
    .build()

val cfWebCheckoutPayment = CFWebCheckoutPaymentBuilder()
    .setSession(cfSession)
    .build()

CFPaymentGatewayService.getInstance().doPayment(this@YourActivity, cfWebCheckoutPayment)
```

```kotlin
// Implement CFCheckoutResponseCallback in your Activity
override fun onPaymentVerify(orderID: String) {
    // Verify from backend — don't fulfill here
}

override fun onPaymentFailure(cfErrorResponse: CFErrorResponse, orderID: String) {
    // Handle failure
}
```

> For iOS, Flutter, React Native, and Cordova — see `REFERENCE.md`.

### Step 3: Handle Callback

Two callbacks:
- **`onVerify(orderID)`** — Payment likely succeeded. MUST verify from backend before fulfilling.
- **`onError(errorResponse, orderID)`** — Payment failed. Display appropriate message.

**CRITICAL:** `onVerify` does NOT guarantee success. Always verify server-side.

### Step 4: Verify Payment (Backend — MANDATORY)

When the SDK fires `onVerify`/`verifyPayment`, the mobile app must call **your backend**, which then fetches the real order status from Cashfree. Never fulfill based on the mobile callback alone.

**Callback names per platform:**

| Platform | Success callback | Failure callback |
|---|---|---|
| Android (Kotlin/Java) | `onPaymentVerify(orderID: String)` | `onPaymentFailure(error, orderID)` |
| iOS (Swift) | `verifyPayment(order_id: String)` | `onError(error, order_id)` |
| Flutter | `verifyPayment(String orderId)` | `onError(CFErrorResponse, String)` |
| React Native | `onVerify(orderID: string)` | `onError(error, orderID)` |
| Cordova | `onVerify(result.orderID)` | `onError(error.orderID)` |

**Your backend then calls `GET /orders/{order_id}` (or SDK equivalent):**

```javascript
// Node.js backend (cashfree-pg v5)
const response = await cashfree.PGFetchOrder(orderId);
const status = response.data.order_status; // "PAID" | "ACTIVE" | "EXPIRED"
```

```python
# Python backend (cashfree-pg v6+)
response = cashfree.PGFetchOrder(order_id, None, None)
status = response.data.order_status
```

```java
// Java backend
ApiResponse<OrderEntity> response = cashfree.PGFetchOrder(orderId, null, null, null);
String status = response.getData().getOrderStatus(); // "PAID"
```

```go
// Go backend (cashfree-pg v6+)
response, _, err := cashfree.PGFetchOrder(orderId, nil, nil, nil)
```

| `order_status` | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `PAID` | Safe to fulfill |
| `ACTIVE` | Still awaiting payment |
| `EXPIRED` | No successful payment |

> For granular payment-level status (`SUCCESS`, `FAILED`, `PENDING`, `USER_DROPPED`) — use `PGOrderFetchPayments(orderId)`. See `references/REFERENCE.md`.

### Step 5: Process Webhooks

Configure `notify_url` in Create Order. Verify webhook signatures before processing. See the Webhooks skill.

---

## 4. Decision Rules

- **Want all payment methods** → Web Checkout (`CFWebCheckoutPayment`).
- **Want native UPI app selection** → UPI Intent (`CFUPIIntentCheckoutPayment`). See `REFERENCE.md`.
- **Android native** → `com.cashfree.pg:api` via Gradle.
- **iOS native** → `CashfreePG` via SPM or CocoaPods.
- **Flutter** → `flutter_cashfree_pg_sdk` via pub.dev.
- **React Native / Expo** → `react-native-cashfree-pg-sdk`. For Expo: run `npx expo prebuild` (Expo Go is NOT supported).
- **Cordova / Ionic** → `cordova-plugin-cashfree-pg`.
- **Capacitor / Ionic Capacitor** → `capacitor-plugin-cashfree-pg` (dedicated Capacitor 7+ plugin; install alongside `cashfree-pg-api-contract`).

**Callback registration timing:**
- Android → `onCreate()`
- iOS → `viewDidLoad()`
- Flutter → `initState()`
- React Native → `componentDidMount()` (remove in `componentWillUnmount()`)
- Cordova → `onDeviceReady()`

---

## 5. Security Constraints — Never Violate

- **Never expose `x-client-secret` in mobile app code.** SDK authenticates via `payment_session_id`.
- **Never call `POST /orders` from the mobile app.** Create orders server-side only.
- **Never fulfill based on `onVerify` callback alone.** Always verify via `GET /orders/{order_id}` from backend.
- **Never skip webhook signature verification.**
